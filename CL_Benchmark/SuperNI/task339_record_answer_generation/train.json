On Tuesday at a campaign rally in North Carolina, Trump defended the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's record on terrorism, saying, \"He was a bad guy -- really bad guy. But you know what? He did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so well. They didn't read them the rights. They didn't talk. They were terrorists. Over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism.\" Defending the brutal Iraqi dictator who killed hundreds of thousands of his own people isn't exactly fashionable. But if you consider the 13 years of war that have wracked the country -- in which a quarter of a million have died -- and add that Saddam brutally repressed all dissent, including groups such as al Qaeda, and also add to this that ISIS is itself a fruit of the Iraq War, it's a far more defensible position.Peter Bergen: Donald Trump is correct in saying Saddam Hussein repressed terrorist groups, as he did all forms of rebellion and dissentU.S. authorities spread false story of connection between Saddam and terrorists, which was used to help justify Iraq war, Bergen says \n Question:The committee also found that \"most of the contacts cited between Iraq and al-_ before the war by the intelligence community and policy makers have been determined not to have occurred.\"",

Trump Jr. strayed from the campaign's talking point about the Republican nominee's tax returns -- that they'll be released once an IRS audit concludes -- when he said unveiling the documents would \"detract\" from his father's message. And Trump Jr. caused a firestorm when, during a Thursday interview with a Philadelphia radio station, he raised the specter of the Holocaust by saying if Republicans acted like Hillary Clinton, the media would be \"warming up the gas chamber.\" The campaign later said Trump Jr. was referring to capital punishment, though the Clinton campaign quickly seized on the remarks.Trump's children have increased their appearances on the campaign trail in recent weeksIvanka and Don Jr. both cut off interviews when faced with tough questions \n Question:_, in particular, often softens Trump's image and the children are known for exerting power behind the scenes and bringing discipline to the freewheeling campaign.",

        "You are given a concatenated string consisting of two parts that are separated by a newline character. The first part is the user's initial question during a human computer conversation, the second part is a clarifying question asked by the computer in response to the question asked by the user. You should read the input, then generate a valid prediction of the user's response to the computer's clarifying question. A valid prediction will clarify the user's correct intent in the initial question."

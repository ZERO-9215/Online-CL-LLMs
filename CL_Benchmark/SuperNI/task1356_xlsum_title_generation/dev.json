Alun Davies said threatening legal action \"sounds like the last breath before you're thrown out of the pub\". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would \"have a leg to stand on\" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be \"on the table\" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was \"absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation.\" The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump's remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly's Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said \"legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don't have a veto over trade\". \"Politically, I think it's extremely unlikely to happen,\" the international relations and the Welsh language minister said. \"They [the UK Government] should not be concluding any trade agreements without consulting us where we have the power.\" Ms Morgan explained that UK and Welsh government officials are working on an agreement or 'concordat' for how future trade deals are negotiated. During a robust exchange, the Labour AM Alun Davies said: \"I want something which is in law to which I can hold you to account and which colleagues in Westminster can hold the UK Government to account. \"The argument we'll make life difficult for them, it sounds alright on the street, but it's not the reality of intergovernmental relations.\" \"The United Kingdom has to find a way of functioning. \"At the moment, your answers aren't giving me any confidence that there is that structure in place because, if the Welsh Government's argument is, 'we'll see you in court', it's not a very impressive argument either for the continuation of the structure of United Kingdom as a state or the commitment of the government within the United Kingdom to actually work together,\" he added. Responding to the criticism, Ms Morgan said: \"Is the current intergovernmental structure adequate? \"Absolutely not... and it's not just in relation to trade, it's in relation to almost every aspect of government policy. So, that infrastructure needs to be built.\"",

The email contained a spreadsheet listing 172 names and details extenuating circumstances in which extensions and other academic concessions were granted to 42 students. 'Felt sick' It was sent to nearly 300 undergraduates, including Ms Baynes, a former editor of student newspaper Concrete. She is currently awaiting the results of her American Literature and Creative Writing degree, and had been granted extensions for coursework because of an illness suffered by a family member. \"I felt sick at seeing my personal situation written in a spreadsheet, and then seemingly sent to everyone on my course,\" she said. \"My situation was not the worst on there but there are some on there that are so personal. There are people I know and I feel so awful for them and can't imagine how they are feeling.\" Theo Antoniou Phillips, UEA Students' Union undergraduate education officer, said: \"This is a shocking and utterly unacceptable data breach that should never have happened.\" Jo Swo, the union's welfare, community and diversity officer, said: \"Given the university is supposed to be making mental health a priority, this is a real slap in the face to students who have sought support.\" In a statement, a UEA spokeswoman said: \"An email was mistakenly sent to 298 American Studies undergraduates this morning containing details of 42 students with extenuating circumstances. \"This clearly should not have happened and the university apologises unreservedly.

The gas is inhaled using a balloon. Russian investigators reported the deaths, without naming the pair, and said there were no signs of foul play. Bogdanovich was a speed chess champion. Vernigora was also a professional chess player and was studying at Moscow State University. The Ukrainian sports website sport.ua says Bogdanovich was a grandmaster from Odessa who won the Ukrainian Under-18 championship and various chess awards at international tournaments. Russian chess website chess-news.ru says that in 2015 he was rated eighth in the world for speed (blitz) chess. Reports say Bogdanovich drew much criticism recently for representing Russia in an internet chess match against Ukraine, which he won. Sport.ua quotes a Facebook post from him (in Russian) about that, in which he argued that playing for Russia was good for business, that he was living as a guest in Russia and being treated well, and this was his small contribution to ending the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Nitrous oxide was first used as an anaesthetic in 1844, but is now being used as a recreational drug and has been linked to a number of deaths.

Work to rip up the club's artificial pitch and replace it with grass, in keeping with league regulations, is expected to start later on Monday. Fan Brody Pattison joked that he wanted some of the artificial pitch in his back garden as a souvenir. He said: \"I can't thank the players enough, they're all heroes for this town, they're going to go down in history. \"We've come so far as a club in the last three or four years, we're a small town full of teashops and we're in the Football League.\" Another Sulphurites supporter, Jack Wilkinson, said he woke up on Monday with a bottle of champagne and a huge sign saying \"we're going to Wembley\". He said: \"As soon as they scored the first goal, that's when the tears started and they didn't stop until full-time, I'm a grown adult crying over a football match. \"It makes the early mornings going to Dover, Yeovil, Torquay all worth it.\" The Sulphurites also won the praise of what is possibly Harrogate's most famous institution, Bettys tearoom. A spokeswoman said: \"We've the kettle on and Fat Rascals (a kind of scone) in the oven. We're delighted to raise a toast to Simon Weaver and the winning Harrogate team.\" Harrogate businessman Mark Noble was lucky enough to attend the game as a guest of the club. He said: \"The lads were all so proud, the support they've had all season was with them yesterday, the flags were up. \"Yesterday was a large key opening a large door, next season we're in that room and hopefully when Covid is over, all the supporters will all be there following the team.\" Simon Cotton, who runs hotels and pubs in and around the town, said promotion was a \"superb lift\" for Harrogate after \"so many months of lockdown blues\". He said: \"Harrogate relies on visitor tourism and if more fans are travelling to see their teams then they're potentially going to stay in hotels in the town, go for a drink in the bars, have something to eat in the restaurants and buy something in the shops.\" There have been calls for an open-top bus parade, although coronavirus restrictions mean this is unlikely. Harrogate Borough mayor Stuart Martin said: \"We've got to try and think of how best we can celebrate - under normal circumstances, wouldn't it have been nice to have a civic reception for them? - but there's no way we can do that under the current climate, it's just not feasible.\" He said promotion was \"going to bring a real buzz to the town, to the district, to the county\" and would encourage more youngsters to get involved in sport. Lindsey Whitton, captain of Harrogate Town's women's team, said she hoped the club's recent success would inspire more girls to start playing football. She said: \"It's amazing, the profile of the club has just risen so much within 24 hours, not only for the men's team but it's going to have a massive impact on the women's team, the player development centre, the academy.\" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

            "input": "She was the matriarchal figure of a political dynasty that included two presidents - her husband George HW Bush and son George W Bush. Mrs Bush, who was first lady from 1989 to 1993, had been in failing health for some time and had declined further medical treatment. Tributes to her poured in from across the US political establishment. Her husband, at 93, is the longest-lived US president. Their son, George, was elected in 2000 and served two terms as the nation's 43rd president. He said in a statement: \"My dear mother has passed on at age 92. Laura, Barbara, Jenna, and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was. Barbara Bush was a fabulous First Lady and a woman unlike any other who brought levity, love, and literacy to millions.\" Mr Bush said his mother had \"kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end\", adding: \"I'm a lucky man that Barbara Bush was my mother. Our family will miss her dearly, and we thank you all for your prayers and good wishes.\" A statement from the office of her husband described her as a \"relentless proponent of family literacy\". Mrs Bush was also the mother of Jeb Bush, who served as governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007 and unsuccessfully ran for the White House in 2016. As first lady, Mrs Bush went beyond the traditional role of a political spouse, founding the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy to help parents and children from disadvantaged communities to read and write. 'Family rock' She was a fierce advocate of civil rights and went against many of her husband's Republican party supporters with her more liberal view on abortion rights. In a statement from the White House, President Donald Trump said Mrs Bush would be long remembered for her devotion to country and family, \"both of which she served unfailingly well\". Barack and Michelle Obama described her as \"the rock of a family dedicated to public service\" and as \"an example of the humility and decency that reflects the very best of the American spirit\". Another former US president, Bill Clinton, said Mrs Bush was \"feisty in support of her family and friends, her country and her causes\". He said he and Hillary Clinton would \"never forget the courtesy she and President Bush showed us\". Mrs Bush was known for her snow-white hair and was dubbed \"The Silver Fox\" by her family. She once dismissed speculation that she had influenced her husband during his time in the White House, saying: \"I don't fool around with his office and he doesn't fool around with my household.\" Mrs Bush also sparked a debate on gender equality in 1990 with an address to the all-women Wellesley College. She told graduates: \"Who knows, somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the president's spouse and I wish him well.\" George HW Bush, who served as the 41st US president, suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a wheelchair. It was recently announced that Mrs Bush had declined further medical treatment after a series of hospital visits, but the statement did not reveal the nature of her ailments. She said she wanted to spend her last days in \"comfort care\" with her family. Mrs Bush was born Barbara Pierce, the daughter of Marvin Pierce, publisher of McCall's magazine. She grew up in Rye, New York. She met her future husband in 1941 at a Christmas party in Connecticut and the couple celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary in January this year. They had six children including a daughter, Robin, who died of leukaemia aged three in 1953. As well as George and Jeb, the other Bush children are Neil, Marvin and Dorothy. Mrs Bush was one of only two women whose husband and son became US president, and the only one to have seen them both sworn in. Abigail Adams was married to the second US president, John Adams, and was the mother of the sixth, John Quincy Adams, although she did not live to see their son elected.",

But Mr Johnson said quitting means \"we would have to recognise that most of our problems are not caused\" by the EU. Two ministers earlier said they would opt to leave if a vote were held now. However, Education Secretary Michael Gove and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond both said the prime minister must be given a chance to bring powers back from Brussels before the country decides. Mr Cameron has promised to hold an in/out referendum by 2017 - if the Conservatives win the next election - but has said he would campaign to stay within the EU if he was able to secure a new relationship. The Tory backbenchers have tabled an amendment to the motion welcoming the Queen's Speech - in it, they express regret about the absence of legislation paving the way for a referendum. Mr Hammond said it would be \"defeatist\" to leave the EU without attempting reform and said he believed there was a \"reasonable chance\" of securing sufficient changes. The London mayor has previously said that his \"view has always been narrowly in favour of staying in, particularly for protecting British interests in the single market\". 'Sterile debate' In his Daily Telegraph article, Mr Johnson writes: \"I personally back legislation now to make sure that referendum goes ahead. \"It will be a good thing for everyone, because we will all have to focus not on the feud... but on what is actually right for the country\". Mr Johnson said \"renegotiation can only work if we understand clearly what we want to achieve: A pared-down relationship based on free trade and cooperation.... \"If we are going to have any chance of success in the negotiations, we need to show that the UK is willing to walk away.\" He added: \"As the leaders of the EU devote more and more of their time and energy to the single currency and its problems, we cannot honestly claim to be 'at the heart of Europe'. \"The prime minister is absolutely right, in this context, to go for a new and more mature relationship\". The London mayor goes on to list possible advantages for leaving the EU, including saving money and having more powers over immigration rules. Mr Johnson said \"perhaps the most important point of all\" was that the UK would \"no longer\" be able to \"blame Brussels\". He said: \"If we left the EU, we would end this sterile debate\". Mr Johnson said \"most of our problems\" were caused by \"chronic British short-termism, inadequate management, sloth, low skills, a culture of easy gratification and under-investment in both human and physical capital and infrastructure\". He said: \"Why are we still, person for person, so much less productive than the Germans? That is now a question more than a century old, and the answer has nothing to do with the EU. In or out of the EU, we must have a clear vision of how we are going to be competitive in a global economy.\" Among reasons for staying in the EU listed by Mr Johnson were that international companies could be put off from investing in the UK and a risk that leaving would be \"globally interpreted as a narrow, xenophobic, backward-looking thing\".",

            "input": "By Stephen EvansBBC News, Seoul If you doubt the strength of feeling that still exists against Japan, just go to the Japanese embassy in the South Korean capital. All embassies are no doubt fortresses but some at least contrive to look grand and even elegant. But the Japanese embassy in Seoul is built plainly for defence. Its high, unscalable walls have a forbidding fence topped by barbed wire in front of it to form two layers of protection. The embassy itself is a red-brick, modern monolith with blanked windows. Police buses are parked around the perimeter. This is a functional building designed to protect the occupants from outsiders. And the occupants only have to look across the road to see the feelings of many of the outsiders. As Japanese diplomats leave their embassy, they cannot avoid a bronze statue of a sweet-looking girl on a chair. She is a \"comfort woman\", one of the young women dragooned by the Japanese occupiers of Korea and China as \"sex slaves\". Constant accusation Under the bronze chair of the statue are a pair of small, real shoes. In rain, she wears a real raincoat. In the cold, she wears a real scarf. Anti-Japanese protesters tend her daily. She just sits there day and night in silent accusation. The plaque alongside describes the statue somewhat incongruously as a \"peace monument\" to \"Japanese Military Sexual Slavery\". Should the Japanese diplomat stroll to the other side of his embassy in Seoul, he might visit South Korea's National Museum of Contemporary History. At the moment, its special exhibition is a celebration of the life of a Korean nationalist who shot and killed a Prime Minister of Japan more than a century ago, and who waved the Korean flag even as the colonial ruler died. The exhibition is called \"Woolim\" which means echo, by which the museum means, as it says in the accompanying explanation, the echo resounding today from the gunshots which killed the Japanese leader on October 26, 1909. Three days before pulling the trigger, the assassin, Ahn Junggeun, wrote: \"Although the east wind is getting colder, the strong man's spirit is roaring\". The wind from the east came, of course, from Japan and it continues to chill Korea, even today. The Korean nationalist who earlier this year slashed the US ambassador's face with a knife had previously thrown a rock at the Japanese ambassador. Real animosity Japan and the US are the targets of Korean nationalists: the Japanese for the colonial rule over Korea from 1910 until Japan was defeated in 1945, and the Americans for their continuing presence in this country. The big cinema hit last year in South Korea was a film about the admiral who repulsed the invading Japanese fleet in 1597 despite being outnumbered - 13 Korean ships to 133. Four centuries on, they can't even agree on what to call the water between them. Should it be the East Sea or the Sea of Japan? The Japanese foreign ministry had no doubts: \"The name Sea of Japan is the only internationally established name for the sea area concerned. \"Japan has strongly opposed the unfounded argument concerning the name Sea of Japan and has called for a better understanding of the issue and support for Japan's position from the international community in order to maintain the sole use of the name, Sea of Japan\". Japanese diplomats in Seoul say they are baffled by it and by the perennial demand for apology, both for the occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945 and for the specific slavery of the women. In China, too, there is still animosity over the undoubted barbarities committed by the Japanese occupiers between 1937 and the Japanese defeat. On this, South Korea and China are aligned against Japan, much to the unease of the US. Why does this ill-feeling continue? After all, Germany and Israel are allies today. Both the US President and the UK Prime Minister rub shoulders easily - even in a friendly fashion - with the Chancellor of Germany. Apologies made It is not as though Japan hasn't apologised. In 1995, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama spoke of \"my feelings of deep remorse\" and stated \"my heartfelt apology\" for Japan's \"colonial rule and aggression (which) caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations\". In 2001, Japanese Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, wrote personally to surviving \"comfort women\" saying that Japan was \"painfully aware of its moral responsibilities\". He wrote: \"As Prime Minister of Japan, I thus extend anew my most sincere apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable and painful experiences and suffered incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women. \"We must not evade the weight of the past, nor should we evade our responsibilities for the future\". The difficulty for Japan (and for the relationship with China and South Korea) is that many to their immediate West don't believe that today's Japanese leaders really do feel the \"weight of the past\". South Korean politicians cite new textbooks approved for use in Japanese schools which seem to soften Japanese guilt and strengthen claims to disputed territory. And the debate in Japan over the wording of apology prompts Koreans to argue that a reworded apology casts doubt on the sincerity of the original. Prime Minster Abe has recently expressed \"deep remorse over the past war\" but, say Korean sceptics, remorse does not imply apology. One of the academic experts in Japan's relations with its neighbours said Japan had done \"far more apologising and contrition than the world average\". Politicians' interest Robert Dujarric, the director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University's Tokyo campus, added that \"several Japanese leaders have eviscerated past apologies\". He cites the current prime minister as one of the backers listed as an \"assentor\" for an advert in US newspapers which said that the comfort women were not sex slaves but \"working under a system of licensed prostitution which was common around the world at the time\". The advert said that many of the women \"earned incomes far in excess of what were paid to field officers and even generals\". This is not the language of remorse. Some of those behind the advert also referred to the \"Nanking Hoax\" - so angering the Chinese who do not view the rape and slaughter of between 20,000 and 300,000 civilians and prisoners in Nanjing in 1937 as in dispute (apart from the actual numbers, which differ according to which side of the Sea of Japan you view the facts from.) Nanking Massacre: China says up to 300,000 civilians, many of them women and children, were massacred by Imperial Japanese forces when the city of Nanking was occupied by Japan's troops in 1937. In Japan, however, there is heated debate about the scale of the killings, and some nationalists deny that it ever took place. This has caused tension in the relationship between Japan and China. Chinese President Xi Jinping presided over his country's first state commemoration of the Nanjing massacre last year. The view of Japanese diplomats in Seoul is that clear apologies have been made and that they still stand. There is also a feeling that the row is being got up by Korean politicians. It is true that Japan and South Korea seem more similar in character than, let's say, either country and China. Cultures mesh and the people seem to get along. In foreign universities, Japanese and Korean students gravitate towards each other. But the governments of South Korea and Japan also find reason to keep historical enmities going, according to Professor Brian Myers of Dongseo University on the South Korean coast looking out towards Japan. \"The governments of both countries are responsible for systematically whipping up animosity towards each other\", he told the BBC. \"I don't believe this animosity would still be existing at the pitch it is at today, 70 years after liberation, if the governments on both sides of the East Sea didn't have an interest in keeping it going\".",

Service industries grew by 0.8%, production by 0.1% while construction contracted by 2.5%. The UK economy expanded by 0.3% in the same period and by annual rate of 0.3%. Within the service industries, which account for more than 72% of the Scottish economy, the strongest growth of 5% was in financial and insurance activities. Distribution, hotels and catering as well as retail all saw negative growth of about 1%. The contraction in construction followed growth of 2% in the final three months of 2012 and, on an annual basis, this sector expanded by 2.3%. Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said: \"Scotland is benefiting from the security, scale and influence provided by the UK, pooling resources from a UK-wide tax base, unrestricted access to a single domestic market from which we do two thirds of our trade with the same regulation in Wick as in Weymouth.\" 'Strong performance' For the Scottish government, Enterprise Minister Fergus Ewing said: \"Scotland's economy continues to grow faster than the UK with a strong performance across the business services and finance sector. \"We can build on these figures but we cannot allow Westminster's continued pursuit of austerity over economic recovery to derail the positive developments we are seeing in Scotland.\" The Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) said the latest GDP and unemployment statistics supported its view that \"caution must be exercised\" when assessing Scotland's immediate economic prospects. General Secretary Grahame Smith: \"Unemployment is now back at the level of autumn last year. \"It is clear that any nascent recovery is having very limited impact in tackling the stock of unemployment created through the recession.\" 'Tentative recovery' The Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland (FSB) said the latest figures were another indication of a \"tentative economic recovery\" north of the border. Scottish policy convenor Andy Willox added: \"To accelerate growth, the FSB urges the UK government to take action to tackle rising overheads, such as the cost of finance, fuel and utilities, which our members say pose real barriers to their growth and success. \"Further, the FSB's latest research shows that there's lot of work to be done north of the border to use the public sector's spending power as a means to sustain and develop our local business communities.\"",

The machines get oxygen into the lungs and remove carbon dioxide from the body when people are too sick to breathe on their own. That might sound simple but it is crucial to keep pressure to a minimum to avoid causing further damage. In addition, if the oxygen level is too high, that can do harm. As a result, intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators need to not only keep people breathing but also accurately monitor their lungs, using a mix of airflow, temperature, humidity and pressure sensors. Hospitals across the world now urgently need more of this kit. In the UK, the government is speaking to a wide range of manufacturers to see if they can lend a hand. The goal is to have \"many times\" the current number - about 20,000 additional machines as quickly as possible. \"The fact the government is asking manufacturers to make a different product to what they normally make is unprecedented since the World War Two,\" Justin Benson, from the consultancy KMPG, said. \"It's a relatively complex piece of equipment with lots of components and a dedicated supply chain. So asking someone who makes a car to produce a respirator would take them some time.\" Others are more plain spoken about the idea ventilator assembly lines could be established at places such as Honda's Swindon plant. \"It would take too long,\" said Stephen Phipson, chief executive of the engineering trade body Make UK. \"We already have companies that build other people's designs for them - everything from alarm systems to signalling systems for trains. These are the companies you need, which can place components on circuit boards, do the wiring, testing and assembling. Building cars is a very different matter.\" 'Ready and willing' So while big name manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce and JCB have also been invited to discuss playing a role, it could be lesser known companies that take the lead. Gloucestershire-based Renishaw is one to have already been approached by the Cabinet Office. The company makes small precision-measurement parts, which are used in other types of medical equipment as well as aircraft. \"We're still trying to understand the medical device requirements,\" said spokesman Chris Pockett. \"But we're willing and want to contribute to the national effort.\" Woking-headquartered TT Electronics is another potential contributor. It makes speciality coils and ultra-fine wound wire for radiation therapy equipment and surgical navigation devices. Although its involvement with ventilators has been limited to producing power supplies, a spokeswoman said it was \"ready to help in any way that we can\". Other parts, however, may still need to be sourced from further afield. This is where companies such as Dyson might have a role to play, suggested Make UK, helping to ensure supplies of semiconductor chips and other parts that would be too complex to make locally. \"It takes us a matter of weeks to scale up a factory to assemble something but sometimes the lead time on these components can be months,\" said Mr Phipson. \"So making sure that that point is covered off first, which is the priority, is really important.\" A spokeswoman for Dyson said it was already \"working with other companies to see if we can provide a rapid solution\". Safety checks It typically takes two to three years to develop and launch a ventilator. So convincing the industry's big players - such as General Electric and Philips - to let their products be made locally under licence is the likely plan of action. However, there would still be other hurdles to overcome. Abingdon-based Penlon already makes a bulkier type of ventilator used during anaesthesia. Its marketing chief, Craig Thompson, warned bureaucracy may be the biggest challenge of all. \"Ventilators are less sophisticated than things like smartphones and Xboxes,\" he said. \"This is not a technical challenge but a regulatory compliance one.\" Even if a ventilator used an existing design, he said, it still needed to undergo rigorous testing if made at a new site. And following that, there was usually a long wait for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to sign off the product. Under normal circumstances, all this typically takes a year. \"The purpose of the process is to make sure that the device is effective and safe, and it takes a long time,\" Mr Thompson said. And even an expedited procedure would probably still take too long. \"The NHS is looking for a solution for this crisis in the next six to eight weeks,\" he said. \"The only way you can make that requirement would be to source them from existing factories, so definitely not from the UK.\" Make UK was more optimistic and suggested such a regulatory impasse could be overcome if there was enough political pressure. But it too warned making the kinds of numbers of ventilators the NHS needed may not be possible in the timescale desired. \"You could end up with some components taking 20 weeks to deliver,\" said Mr Phipson. \"We need to go through the detail and work out what is possible. We should have a clearer picture by the end of the week.\"",

The order means taxis from these services will now attract a fine or even be impounded, officials say. The Uber driver accused of rape has been arrested and remanded in custody. The 26-year-old woman had used the Uber smartphone app to book a taxi home on Friday night but said she was taken to a secluded area and raped. Although the driver has not yet given a statement, police say he has confessed to the crime. \"Following the incident of a heinous crime... the government of Delhi has banned Uber to provide any transport related service in Delhi,\" the home ministry said in a message to state governments around the country. All internet-based taxi services which are not licensed with the government are also prohibited from operating until they get registered, the letter says, adding that all other states and federally-administered union territories are advised to do the same. In an order issued late on Monday, the Delhi government said only six registered radio taxi companies were being allowed to continue to operate in the capital. \"All other transport/ taxi service providers through web-based technology, who are not recognised, are prohibited from providing such services... till they get licence/permission from the transport department,\" S Roy Biswas, Delhi's deputy commissioner of transport, said. Media reports said the ban could hit a number of taxi services in the city, and thousands of drivers would be out of work. A BBC correspondent in Delhi says Uber is still accepting bookings on its app and it is not yet clear how the ban will be enforced since Uber taxis do not carry any visible branding. Uber has not yet commented on the ban. On Monday, the company described the incident as \"horrific\" and said it would do everything \"to help bring this perpetrator to justice\". The latest allegation of rape has again put the spotlight on the issue of sexual violence against Indian women, following a series of recent incidents. It comes days before the second anniversary of the gang rape and murder of a student on a bus in Delhi, which prompted global outrage and a tightening of the laws on sexual violence. Meanwhile, #DelhiShamedAgain and #Uber are among the top Twitter trends in India with many people taking to social media to express their outrage at the incident. Natasha said banning all online taxi companies was \"ridiculous\": Dr Munish Raizada said although India has a new government now, nothing really had changed: Siddharth Jain said banning Uber was \"no solution\":",

            "input": "By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Experts think one government motive for backing civilian nuclear power is to cross-subsidise the defence industry. They say nuclear power is so expensive that it should be scrapped in favour of much cheaper renewable energy. Others argue that nuclear still plays a key role in keeping on the lights, so the military aspect is not significant. But in evidence to MPs on the Business Select Committee, researchers from the University of Sussex said the government should be frank about the inter-dependence of the civilian nuclear programme and the nuclear defence industry. Supply chain Prof Andy Stirling from Sussex argues that one reason the government is willing to burden householders with the expense of nuclear energy is because it underpins the supply chain and skills base for firms such as Rolls Royce and Babcock that work on nuclear submarines. He said: “It is clear that the costs of maintaining nuclear submarine capabilities are insupportable without parallel consumer-funded civil nuclear infrastructures. “The accelerating competitiveness of renewable energy and declining viability of nuclear power are making this continuing dependency increasingly difficult to conceal.” Rolls Royce, which makes reactors for nuclear submarines, has been pressing the government to agree a fleet of small modular reactors for power generation in the UK. This civilian technology would be transferable to submarines. 'Persuasive' evidence A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: \"We believe having a diverse energy mix is the best way of ensuing energy security while allowing us to meet our climate commitments. \"Nuclear has an important role to play as we transition to a low-carbon economy, but as with any technology, it must represent good value for money for the taxpayer and consumer.\" A committee source told BBC News the researchers' evidence appeared persuasive and well-researched. The committee is expected to release the evidence in coming days as it prepares to discuss whether the UK really needs nuclear power for energy security. The debate has taken on greater significance as the true costs of nuclear power have been revealed. It was once forecast that nuclear energy would be too cheap to meter. But it's clear now that bill-payers will give price support to the Hinkley Point C nuclear station at a cost of £92.50 per megawatt hour, compared with the cheapest agreed future subsidy of £57.50 for offshore wind. Ministers expect that, before long, wind energy will operate without support. Prof Stirling says the issue of nuclear inter-dependence is addressed openly in the US. In 2017, the former US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz (a nuclear scientist) said: “A strong domestic (nuclear) supply chain is needed to provide for Navy requirements. This has a very strong overlap with commercial nuclear energy.” Prof Stirling told BBC News: \"We need this sort of transparency in the UK.\" Catch-22 But the government faces a Catch-22 situation on this issue. If it continues to decline to admit the inter-dependence of civil and military nuclear, it will stand accused of hiding a self-evident truth. But if it accepts that decisions on nuclear power are influenced with half an eye on manufacturing jobs and nuclear deterrent, it will face resistance from consumer groups unwilling to cross-subsidise submarines. The MPs’ hearing is timely, as the government will shortly publish an energy white paper outlining how the UK will supply electricity in a zero carbon economy. Follow Roger on Twitter.",

Southwark Crown Court heard data showed her phone had never been used near the Grenfell site. Last month, Msokeri was found guilty of fraud and possessing a false document. Sentencing her, Judge Michael Grieve QC said her offences were \"callous and contemptible, indeed disgusting\". \"Your greed in taking advantage of the situation you had created was insatiable,\" he added. Msokeri, of Ambleside Gardens in Sutton, south London, claimed goods including handbags and dresses, accommodation and cash handouts worth a total of £19,000. But prosecutor David Jeremy QC said she would have had access to funds totalling more than £200,000 if other benefits she applied for or could have applied for but did not receive due to her arrest are counted. The court heard Msokeri concocted an elaborate ploy to claim insurance on her fictitious partner's death. When her story began to unravel, she told investigators she had found out her husband had survived and had been living in a cave in Margate, Kent, where he was fed by tourists. Msokeri eventually persuaded a man with a history of mental health problems to pose as her spouse so she could claim he had miraculously been found weeks after the fire. Kate Mulholland, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Msokeri's offences \"involved the exploitation of extremely vulnerable people, as well as the breach of trust of survivors, donors and relief workers\". Msokeri was found guilty of three counts of fraud against the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), the Hilton and charities plus a further charge of possessing a false document. A RBKC spokesman said: \"We approach every case with the view of doing our very best to support individuals and families wherever and however we can. \"Unfortunately, as in this case, there is a small minority who came forward and tried to take advantage of this, with the sole purpose of gaining something out of a tragedy.\"",

He denied the allegations but for some they were serious enough for them to go against their party and support Mr Jones. Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican senator from Arizona who says he is not seeking re-election, donated $100 (£75) to Mr Jones's campaign, and responded with a simple message after Mr Jones won. Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, said the Democratic victory proved a \"humbling night\" for the Republican party. Despite campaigning for Mr Moore for weeks, US President Donald Trump congratulated Mr Jones on his win, and followed it up with a tweet distancing himself from Mr Moore's defeat, claiming, \"Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!\" As of Tuesday night, Mr Moore had refused to concede, saying \"it's not over\". Several Republicans encouraged him to concede. The former governor of Arkansas, Republican Mike Huckabee, urged Mr Moore to \"exit with class.\" \"In elections everyone does NOT get a trophy,\" he said. Meanwhile, Democrats celebrated the victory across social media. New Jersey Democratic representative Bonnie Watson Coleman applauded black women for securing the victory.

He told the BBC he would be \"fighting the corner for my budget and defence\". The Ministry of Defence said while budgets for 2015-16 onwards had yet to be set, it had been promised a 1% annual increase in equipment spending. Britain currently spends around £34bn a year on defence. Speaking to the BBC, as he watched a Royal Marines training exercise in Norway, Mr Hammond said: \"There may be some modest reductions we can make through further efficiencies and we will look for those, but we won't be able to make significant further cuts without eroding military capability.\" He added: \"We have some very challenging targets ahead of us to deliver the outcome of the last spending review and I'm clear that we won't be able to deliver big further savings. \"But we need to look broadly across government at how we are going to do that, not just narrowly at a few departments.\" 'Collision course' Reductions in defence spending for 2013-15, in addition to those in 2010's Strategic Defence and Security Review, were outlined in last year's Autumn Statement. And Downing Street said last month the military would not be immune from further financial cuts in Chancellor George Osborne's next spending review - which is due to be published before the end of this year and will set out government spending plans for the first half of the next parliament. A report this week from the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) suggested this could lead to additional reductions of more than £1bn a year in the defence budget from 2015. However, returning from a trade visit to India in February, Prime Minister David Cameron said he was open to the idea of diverting money from the UK's £10bn aid budget to MoD projects, including peacekeeping and other security-related development. In a Daily Telegraph interview, Mr Hammond said a number of Conservative cabinet ministers believed \"that we have to look at the welfare budget again... if we are going to get control of public spending on a sustainable basis\". BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale says that, because Mr Hammond and other Tory ministers want a greater proportion of savings to come from the welfare budget, they are on a collision course with their Liberal Democrat partners. Former leader of the Lib Dems, Sir Menzies Campbell, told BBC Radio 4's Saturday PM programme he understood the defence secretary's concerns, warning: \"The real issue is you have to balance your resources against your ambitions, and the problem at the moment is that the resources keep being reduced, but the ambitions stay as grand as ever.\" He admitted looking elsewhere for possible cuts was a \"difficult issue\" for the coalition, but said the chancellor had a \"responsibility to make sure the poorest people are protected\" if the welfare budget was reduced. Battle lines Our defence correspondent says tense negotiations over the next public spending round are already under way and Mr Hammond was publicly drawing the lines of battle. Conservative MP Patrick Mercer said Mr Hammond's comments were \"a warning shot across Treasury bows and Lib Dem bows\". He told BBC Radio 5 live it came at \"an extremely febrile time\" on the back of the Eastleigh by-election, which the Liberal Democrats won while the Conservatives were pushed into third place. Labour MP Paul Flynn told Radio 5 live Mr Hammond had started \"the annual game of horse trading that goes on at every department saying, 'we can't have any cuts here'\". \"Every department should take these cuts,\" he said. Referring to a report by the Public Accounts Committee - which revealed the MoD had bought £1.5bn worth of equipment between 2009 and 2011 that it had not used - he said it had been \"most outrageously wasteful in spending\". In response to Thursday's report, the government pledged \"to reverse decades of lax inventory management\". Scottish National Party MSP Bill Kidd said a \"simple\" solution to save money within the defence budget was not to renew the Trident nuclear weapons programme \"which would save £100bn\".",

That is a 6.7% fall from the same period last year and marks China's weakest FDI report since January 2013. Economists say prospects of slower growth in the world's second-largest economy may have deterred foreign investors. China's economy expanded at the pace of 7.4% in the first three months of this year, down from 7.7% growth in the previous quarter. Earlier this year, Premier Li Keqiang set a target of about 7.5% growth for 2014. China's GDP growth has been falling since 2010, when it stood at 10.4%. FDI includes greenfield investment projects, such as newly built factories, as well as mergers and acquisitions. And the monthly FDI figures can fluctuate as individual investment projects are announced. The FDI data comes as Mr Li is in the UK on a three-day visit, looking to drum up more investment from the UK. Domestic boost To counter the reliance on foreign investment and external factors for growth, China has also been looking to pursue economic growth at home by boosting its infrastructure. Earlier this month, the State Council said China would build a multi-tier transport system along the Yangtze River, to help create a new economic belt. According to official data, the 11 provinces and municipalities along the river account for almost 41% of China's overall gross domestic product.

            "input": "By Holly Rubenstein Entertainment reporter The Danish Girl comes in a year that has put transgender issues firmly into the spotlight. From the transition of Bruce to Caitlyn Jenner, to the Emmy-winning success of Amazon's series Transparent, even the White House chose to screen The Danish Girl as part of a celebration of LGBT artists. Ironic, then, that Hooper has said the script was passed around for about 12 years struggling to secure backing because of what was seen as the story's limited appeal. \"I hope it provides a message of hope,\" says the Oscar-winning Hooper, who has previously worked with Redmayne on Elizabeth I and Les Miserables. \"It's a message that transgender history matters. These were two extraordinary pioneers of the transgender movement who I think history had marginalised.\" Facing criticism Before locking the final cut of the film, he decided to screen the movie to one of Les Miserables' musical directors, who was in the process of transitioning while making the film. \"The lights came up and she had tears on her face, and she said the amazing words, 'How did you know?' She said it was in many respects very true to her own experience and that was for me the most exciting.\" Despite this sensitivity to the subject matter, Hooper has faced criticism for not choosing to cast a transgender woman in the title role. He defended the decision, telling Variety that access to trans actors is limited, and that he had always had Redmayne in mind. \"There was something in Eddie that was drawn to the feminine,\" he says. \"He played the girls' parts in school plays. I was a bit like Gerda in the film because Gerda becomes fascinated by the femininity in her husband and starts to paint it. I was fascinated by the femininity in Eddie and wanted to explore it.\" The film is as much about Gerda, and her demonstration of unconditional love and acceptance through an experience which is as much a transition for her as for her husband. \"I looked up to her,\" says Vikander. \"I questioned, would I be able to do what she did. It was an extraordinary experience trying to find that strength because she's never passive. Lili needs to be who she is but Gerda makes the decision to stand by her side. I'm a romantic at heart.\" In fact, it is Gerda who suggests her husband dresses as a woman. She asks Wegener to first pose for a painting, but more significantly then suggests he attends a ball dressed as Lili, and she goes on to paint portraits of her husband as a woman. \"You helped bring Lili to life but she was always there,\" Lili later tells Gerda. So did Gerda always know that her husband wanted to be a woman? \"She was able to see the inner self of the person she loved… When you know somebody really well, it's not a big surprise when something comes up to the surface,\" says Vikander. Award nominations Vikander's scene-stealing performance, which has been nominated for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award, gives the film \"tremendous heart\", says Hooper. \"It's phenomenal. In her hands Gerda never feels like a victim, which I think is really interesting.\" It has been an extraordinary year for the Swede who came to the public's attention with roles in The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Testament of Youth, Burnt and Ex Machina, for which she has been nominated for another Golden Globe. Her star is set to rise further when she acts alongside Matt Damon in the fifth Jason Bourne movie. Redmayne is attracting an equal amount of attention, following his Screen Actors Guild and Golden Globe best actor nominations for his role. The 33-year-old won the best actor award at this year's Oscars for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, another transformative role. With the screenplay originating from 2004, The Danish Girl has been 11 years in the making, its subject matter proving it a difficult film for Hollywood's financiers to get behind. But the critical recognition being given to Hooper, Vikander and Redmayne shows they are together a winning combination - and suggesting The Danish Girl was worth the wait.

Labrinth, who rose to fame as a producer and writer for Tinie Tempah, was another popular winner, picking up the best song trophy for Earthquake, his hit collaboration with the rapper. He confirmed his transition to star status with a performance that saw him begin by playing a grand piano and end by wielding a guitar in front of banks of pyrotechnics. Labrinth is currently number one in the UK singles chart with a collaboration with Emeli Sande.

But Maynard said: \"I grew up listening to people like Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder and a lot of my musical influences are black artists.\" JLS heartthrob Jonathan \"JB\" Gill said a lot had changed in the charts in recent years. \"I don't think that music of black origin is any longer unrepresented,\" he told BBC News. \"A few years ago guys like Wiley and Dizzee Rascal might not have been recognised, now they're getting to number one. That's an incredible step for music of black origin and the Mobo Awards. They're definitely starting to put a lot of artists on the map.\" But Mobo founder Kanya King rejected the suggestion that the Mobos' mission was now complete. \"The gospel winner, the jazz winner - where else are they going to get a platform?\" she said. \"Who else is going to champion them? \"And it's amazing to have someone like Dionne Warwick on the same stage as some of the up-and-coming stars. It helps to bring it to a global audience. Our work is never done.\" Warwick, known for hits like Heartbreaker and Walk On By, said that without black music, \"you wouldn't have any music\". But asked what she thought of the current crop of artists she had seen perform at the ceremony, she replied: \"It's been, er, interesting.\" Emeli Sande was \"wonderful\", the 71-year-old said, but added that modern pop was \"not for my ears - it's for younger ears\".",

            "input": "Some Conservative MPs joined Labour in calling for the 58 documents, which focus on different sectors of the economy, to be published. Labour is seeking to use an arcane parliamentary procedure to force the government's hand. The government did not contest the motion and earlier said there was an \"obligation\" not to publish the papers. After the motion was carried unanimously, Commons Speaker John Bercow said: \"It is sensible for us, the House, to wait for the government's response and if I receive a representation I will reflect upon it\" He said MPs should not expect the response on Wednesday but, when pressed by Conservative Sarah Wollaston, he indicated that he would not expect the House to have to wait \"for a period of several days\". On Monday the government published the list of sectors that have been looked at, ranging from aerospace and aviation to tourism and legal services, but has argued that releasing them would undermine its negotiating position with the EU. During the Commons debate, former Conservative minister Anna Soubry said the documents should be published and could be redacted if necessary. Another Conservative MP, Sarah Wollaston, said they should be sent to \"all relevant select committees\". Labour, which organised the debate, sought to make use of what it called an \"ancient, but still effective\" parliamentary tool to secure the documents' publication. This involved tabling a motion that \"an humble address be presented to Her Majesty\" requiring that the reports \"be laid before this House and that the impact assessments arising from those analyses be provided to the Committee on Exiting the European Union\". The unusual tactic won the support of Tory Eurosceptic backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said the motion should be binding on the government, and during the debate MPs appealed to the Speaker's chair for clarity. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing said it would be for the government to respond, adding: \"It is not for the chair to decide how the minister should answer the question.\" Brexit Minister Robin Walker argued there was a \"clear obligation\" not to release the information. Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said it was a \"victory for Parliament and for democracy\". \"Ministers cannot keep withholding vital information from Parliament about the impact of Brexit on jobs and the economy,\" he said. \"[Brexit Secretary] David Davis must now respond to Parliament's ruling and urgently set a date for when he will share these papers.\" Brexit negotiations are set to resume on 9 and 10 November with the UK seeking to make enough progress to persuade the EU to move talks onto future issues like trade.",

Ms Jones said: \"In order to make improvements in the diversity of your team of foster carers you have to know what the statistics are for what you have. \"A diversity of foster carers brings a wider range of experiences which can only be beneficial for the authority.\" Sarah Thomas from AFA Cymru said: \"We need to ensure that each local authority can report on the demographics of their fostering workforce. \"From the data we have collected over the past three years we know that recruitment numbers are improving, however, not all local authorities are measuring the numbers of LGBT foster carers coming into fostering so we do not know the impact of this work as yet.\" Ms Jones and her wife Serena Jones fostered through a Swansea Council scheme after speaking to them at Swansea Pride. \"I think Foster Swansea has done a lot to reach out to the LGBT community,\" she said. \"We wanted to have children of our own for a long time... obviously it's more complicated but it didn't work out. \"We were still in the process of chewing over what to do next and we met [them] at Pride. It was a bit like fate... \"To see them at Pride, I can't believe how much it blew my mind. These people were once asking if lesbians should raise children and now they were at our event.\" They fostered their first child in 2015 then a second a few months later. The first stayed for a few months - they are still in touch and send birthday presents - and the second, now 12, has has been with them for four years. \"She's with us long term, 18 plus,\" said Ms Jones, who says she is keen to encourage other potential LGBT foster parents. \"If you're LGBT you're bringing an asset, not a deficit anymore. It's something you should be proud of,\" she said. \"We're bringing experience of being marginalised into a world where children are being marginalised. As an adult we've learnt to cope and we can share that with a child.\" Ms Jones said her child's school, peers and other parents had been very supportive. \"We have had someone question whether or not we would be suitable,\" she said. \"Our child is of a different faith to our own and we had someone question that... it was not someone within the fostering services, it was someone else in social services. \"She [the complainant] was pulled [up on it] immediately and we were supported.\" According to the most recent figures from children's charity Barnardo's Cymru, in March 2018 there were 6,405 looked-after children in Wales, with 74% accommodated in foster care placements. It said 64% of looked-after children had been abused or neglected. Wales' 22 local authorities were asked how many LGBT foster carers they employed and if there had been a rise over the past five years. Of the seven that responded, three said they currently employed LGBT foster carers but did not have figures. The remaining four employed 12 between them. Andrew White, director of LGBT rights campaign group Stonewall Cymru, is also a trustee for Tact, the UK's largest fostering and adoption charity. He said: \"The principle of monitoring all protected characteristics, including sexual orientation, has been embedded in the Welsh equality duties for some years. \"Monitoring is important as it helps track progress which is why we [Tact] keep comprehensive records on all our foster carers, including sexual orientation.\" Mr White called for more targeted and relatable advertising to attract more LGBT carers.",

While town councillor Alun Williams called damage \"superficial\", he said many towns could be \"under threat\" from high tides caused by severe weather. The Welsh Government said funding is prioritised based on risk to life. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme Mr Williams said: \"Wales as a nation has sea on three sides and if key towns like Aberystwyth are under threat, many others must be also. \"We need a national programme for sea defences. \"Councils are happy to help, but 15 out of 22 have a coastline, which means major infrastructure planning at all levels is needed.\" Echoing his calls, Richard Griffiths, who runs the Richmond Hotel on Aberystwyth's sea front, described the current defences as \"old, tired and brittle\". Ceredigion council said Marine Terrace from the junction on Terrace Road to the junction on Albert Place will remain closed to vehicles until 12:00 BST on Tuesday due to clearing and repair work. While Mr Griffiths said the latest storm did not cause the same scale of damage as one in 2014, he pointed to large boulders that make up the sea wall being knocked out of place by waves. He also said small bricks that formed the surface were \"tossed around like confetti\". \"We have to look seriously at how we can improve it. In parts, maybe taking away the old Victorian defences and putting in new ones,\" he said. \"Creating a curve shape that sends the impact of the waves back to sea. It is inevitable we will have to look at this. \"There is no point patching it up as this is not going away because we will have storm after storm.\" A Welsh Government spokesman said it is for risk management authorities, such as Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and local councils, to put forward schemes to be considered based on local priorities. \"We prioritise funding based on risk to life, using the communities at risk register, which combines multiple sources of flood risk, alongside local evidence,\" the spokesman said. \"Over this government term we will provide over £144m to local authorities and NRW to reduce the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.\" Ceredigion council has been asked to comment.",

She released her sixth album, The Truth About Love in 2012, when Barack Obama was the US president. Her seventh, Beautiful Trauma, is released in October among political unrest in America and across the world. But as an artist who has recorded anthems for underdogs throughout her career with hits such as Don't Let Me Get Me, Raise Your Glass and So What, she says she is still fighting \"an old fight.\" \"I've been marching on Washington since I was three years old with my dad,\" she tells Newsbeat. \"I'm a feminist and I believe in equality and I believe in banishing racism and homophobia and sexism and all the isms but we have always been the underdog. \"That line of thought has always been fought. It's an old fight and they're never going to win because we're not going anywhere. \"So you can even have peace and accept it or you can continue to be an idiot.\" Pink covered Sam Smith's Stay With Me in the Live Lounge. In 2006 Pink took direct aim at the then-president George Bush in her song Dear Mr President, but she plans no such attack on the Donald Trump. \"There are no words for that guy,\" she says. But it's not just global politics that concerns this superstar. During her 17-year pop career, Pink says one of the worst things she has seen emerge is fierce rivalries between female stars and their devoted fan bases. In August, she performed and gave an emotional speech at the MTV VMAs where all eyes were on Katy Perry and Taylor Swift. Katy performed her diss-track Swish Swish while Taylor premiered the video for her revenge track, Look What You Made Me Do, at the ceremony. But Pink has no time for rivalries and wants to see more support for women in pop. \"Music is a big enough platform where everybody can win at the same time so why not support your fellow females,\" she tells Newsbeat. \"Why not support the people who are fighting the good fight for you?\" Pink famously clashed with Christina Aguilera when they covered Lady Marmalade in 2001 over who would sing which part, but the 37-year-old mum of two put that rivalry to rest a long time ago. \"I think Christina is incredibly talented, we've had our **** but it's done,\" she says. She also wants to see more support and less rivalry between fans of the artists. \"When I was growing up I listened to all kinds of people, there weren't these groups of fans that were attacking everyone else's fan bases. \"It's very catty and very snarky. \"Honestly I'm just so tired of the snarkiness.\" Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat",

The famous sessile oak tree had a girth of 42ft 5in (12.9m). Legend has it that Welsh princes used to rally troops at the tree. The oak - which had a huge hollow trunk said to big enough to seat six people at a table - had become a local attraction for walkers and visitors in recent years. Rob McBride, a so-called \"tree hunter\" who measures and logs trees, said it was rare for an oak to live to such an age, with most usually lasting around 900 years. \"The tree was one of the biggest and oldest oak trees on the planet,\" said Mr McBride, who lives close to the Pontfadog Oak. \"It has a very significant history and until about 200 years ago was a tree that was pollarded - with branches and leaves regularly cut to feed animals and build fencing.\" He added that villagers had gathered after hearing about the tree, adding: \"It's quite like a wake\". Mr McBride said he had been campaigning for ancient trees like the Pontfadog Oak to be given a protected status like castles. \"If it had had a few thousand pounds spent on some supporting work, it may well have stayed upright,\" he said. 'Almighty crash' The tree is believed to have been a rallying point for Welsh princes, including Owain Gwynedd who is said to have met his troops under the oak in the 12th Century before defeating King Henry II of England in battle. Dianne Coakley-Williams, whose husband Huw's family owned the oak and its land for generations, said she was woken by an \"almighty crash and a bang\" as it fell near their house at about 02:20 BST on Thursday. \"The wind here was absolutely dreadful - I've never known anything like it before ever,\" she said. \"I suppose it's lucky that nobody was hurt. But it's just so sad. My mother-in-law is devastated. She said it's like losing an old friend.\" Angharad Evans of the Woodland Trust said the tree had had a lot to cope with over the past few weeks, with heavy snow, a prolonged cold snap and finally high winds. \"The Woodland Trust believes that this sad case illustrates how we are failing to provide adequate protection for our ancient trees at present,\" she added. Local assembly member Ken Skates said Wrexham had lost one of its \"most important and iconic pieces of local heritage\". But Mr McBride said some people were also talking about the possibility of re-erecting the tree. \"It's early days. They would have to take the top off and then re-erecting it, which can be done. It's such a significant tree,\" he added.",

            "input": "Douglas FraserBusiness/economy editor, Scotland Meet Sir Robert Giffen. Born in Strathaven, Lanarkshire in 1837, he worked in a lawyer's office while taking classes at Glasgow University, striding out on an inky career path with a job on the Stirling Journal. It was the grounding for a distinguished career in financial journalism in London, in the early days of The Economist. He went on to become one of Britain's foremost statisticians. By the time of his death in 1910 in Fort Augustus, he had achieved quite a lot. But 110 years later, he's best remembered for having identified, or at least described, the Giffen Effect. This defies the most basic law of economic gravity - when the price rises for a particular product, demand rises too. Because, let's say, a bottle of single malt Scotch whisky becomes more expensive, it can also be perceived as more desirable and so it fetches a higher price. And that may be what we're seeing in the United States. It's not for sure, but something odd has happened to the single malt Scotches being exported to the USA. They've had a 25% tariff slapped on them, to do with a trade dispute over aircraft subsidies, but the latest evidence suggests they've become more attractive to Americans. The figures come from Diageo, the London-based global giant of distilling, with around 40% of the Scotch industry and a proportionately prominent role in its global reach. Its annual results cover the year to 30 June, and they show that exports of single malt Scotch to the US increased since July last year, albeit by a meagre 1%. Its worldwide sales of numerous spirits, beer and Guinness were down more than 8%, profits down 47%, and Scotch sales worldwide were down 17%. Stout disposal The first half of the company's financial year continued a rising tide of consuming spirits worldwide. In key markets, such as the US, beer and wine are in retreat for younger people, and new \"recruits\" to alcohol, in the marketing jargon, are choosing spirits instead, often in cocktails. Tequila has been doing particularly well in the US. But then Covid-19 arrived. At least spirits don't go off as tumbleweed blows through America's saloons. Guinness does, though. Three-quarters of the stout drunk in Europe and Africa is in pubs, restaurants, at festivals and sports grounds. Half a million kegs have been retrieved from the licensed trade. In total, there has been a £7m cost of disposal, and the accounts note a £23m cost of replacement as the on-trade has opened up again. Lockdown also knocked out key opportunities to flog and drink Scotch, starting with the Chinese New Year, and in airports. In countries where whisky is mainly sold in the off-trade of restaurants, pubs and clubs, the fall was very deep. In the USA, however, 80% of Diageo's business is in selling for home consumption, and that has been doing nicely. North America is where Diageo makes half its profits - in the most recent year, down 47% to £2.1bn. Kilmarnock bottle shop And here's just part of the paradox. Despite that 25% tariff, Scotch malts \"continued to perform well, with growth from Oban and Lagavulin, as well as Talisker and Mortlach\". Some of the tariff blow was averted by building up stocks in the US ahead of its introduction, and those helped to see it through the vital Thanksgiving and festive season. Yet two-thirds of Scotch sold to the USA pre-tariff has been blended. With very few exceptions, it's cheaper. And without the 25% tariff, the biggest blend, Johnnie Walker, fell 11%. The momentum of recent marketing pushes has fallen away. To some extent, the strategy is successfully encouraging Americans to trade up to more expensive brands. As chief executive Ivan Menezes told me in fluent marketing jargon: \"Premiumisation trends are strong\". An 11% drop for Johnnie Walker was relatively good news for the company's biggest brand. Around the world, it fell by a whopping 22%. In the big growth markets of Latin America, it was down 33%. Brands with some history in South America, including Buchanan's and Old Parr, were also down sharply. Drinkers were trading down to lesser brands. This was not a good start to the celebrations of the 200th anniversary of Mr Walker starting to sell whisky from his shop in Kilmarnock. Diageo is not backing off, but stepping up its investment. It's is investing a lot in Scottish visitor attractions - more than £150m for four contrasting malt distilleries that contribute to the blend, and the conversion of Fraser's department store on Edinburgh's Princes Street into the Johnnie Walker Experience. It's due to open in the second half of next year. Gooey cakes Apart from making and selling a lot of alcohol, Diageo's strength is in its marketing. And it's interesting to note how it adjusted rapidly to lockdown. Using data intelligence, it could quickly see the shift to home drinking, and to social events being held online. It noted that the number of web searches for \"cocktail shaker\" rose seven-fold. In the US, without a national furlough scheme to replace wages, the company put a lot of money behind efforts to raise funds for unemployed bar-tenders, while using their downtime for extra training opportunities. In several countries, marketing spend was rapidly hauled out of events, and used to align brands with the move into home cooking and baking - notably the contribution of Bailey's Irish whiskey liqueur to desserts and some gooey cake recipes. Production and advertising of Guinness moved quickly to shop sales in cans. As several countries eased the online sales of alcohol, Diageo was quick to pick up the opportunity. That remains \"low single digits\", but it's seen as a positive trend that's worth watching. America First Next week, there will be a further decision from the Trump administration on those US tariffs on single malts. They extend to lots of European cheeses and meat, and in Scotland, to cashmere sweaters and shortbread. They are likely to be continued, but the distillers' fear is that they could be extended to Scotch blends, and beyond 25%. Diageo says the tariffs are of particular concern to smaller distillers with more exposure to single malts. The figures suggest it can afford to be relaxed about them, but it joins the industry in vigorous criticism of being drawn into a dispute over airliner manufacturing. It faces the same 25% punitive tax on sales of its US whiskey into the European Union and UK, because of another trade dispute, this one over steel and aluminium. Britain's trade secretary, Liz Truss, is reported to be making the case against the tariffs as forcefully as possible on a visit to Washington this week. Her leverage is lessened by the eagerness with which the Westminster administration needs to get some form of free trade deal with the USA as the Brexit transition ends. Donald Trump's \"America First\" administration is hardly likely to be generous to foreigners with a presidential election only three months away.",

Dr Valentin Popov, of the school of mathematics and statistics at the university, said: \"We have reasons to believe that the 20mph policy was effective, at least in the short-term. \"This shows that 20mph limits are worth considering in cities where there is a concerted will to reduce road traffic collisions and make roads safer for users.\" However, Dr Popov added the decline may also be due to a cultural shift rather than directly attributable only to the new lower limit. The research was published in the Environment and Planning B journal. Related Internet Links The City of Edinburgh Council",

            "input": "The ministers gave their opinion in a statement released at the end of a two-day meeting of G20 nations in China. Chancellor George Osborne, who is at the event, told the BBC the referendum issue was \"deadly serious\". But former Chancellor Lord Lawson said the G20's warning was \"absurd\" because 15 of its members were outside the EU. Asked if he or his officials had asked for the warning to be included in the statement, Mr Osborne said: \"We've got countries around the table like the United States of America, like the IMF, like the Chinese who frankly don't do what anyone tells them to do.\" However, Lord Lawson told the BBC: \"The British people will not take kindly to being told by the G20 what they should do. And the notion that the UK leaving the EU would cause an economic shock is absurd. \"Fifteen of the members of the G20 are outside the EU, and that hasn't caused an economic shock. Indeed, most of them are doing better than most of the members of the European Union.\" The UK's EU referendum: All you need to know EU vote: Where the cabinet and other MPs stand EU reform deal: What Cameron wanted and what he got UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the G20 announcement was \"no surprise\" as it was \"mates helping each other out\". \"I'm not surprised that big government gets together to support David Cameron,\" he added. \"This is big banks, big business, big government all scratching each other's backs. I don't think that impresses voters.\" Officials travelling with Mr Osborne say the mention of the UK's referendum in the G20 meeting's final communique is unusual. Mr Osborne has denied he pushed for it. The chancellor told the BBC: \"The financial leaders of the world's biggest countries have given their unanimous verdict and they say that a British exit from the EU would be a shock to the world economy. \"And if it's a shock to the world economy imagine what it would do to Britain.\" He added: \"This isn't some adventurous journey into the unknown, with all the humour attached to it, this is deadly serious.\" Analysis By BBC Shanghai correspondent Robin Brant With the gleaming early spring sunshine behind him, as he stood on the bank of Shanghai's Huangpu river, the chancellor said he was \"deadly serious\". He's not the only one. It seems the other 19 leaders at the G20 agree about the \"shock\", as they've called it, if the UK walked out of the EU. It's not a big surprise. The president of hosts China made it clear last year during his Chequers stay that he wants Britain In. But then again China doesn't really do intervention in domestic politics. George Osborne will be pleased to have this significant and very public diplomatic backing as he sits on the plane back home tonight. There's a whiff of the Scottish referendum campaign about it though, when various foreign leaders lined up behind the government position. A senior official from the Treasury told the BBC the chancellor's US counterpart had raised the issue during the meeting, as did others, including senior Chinese officials and Ms Lagarde. US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew later urged UK voters to \"consider the impact\" of voting to leave, and said the White House believed it was in the UK's \"national security interests\" to remain in the union. Elsewhere, Prime Minister David Cameron was in Northern Ireland as part of his UK tour to persuade voters that membership of a reformed EU is in their best interests. CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn described the potential consequences of the UK leaving the EU as an \"evident risk\". 'Out is out' \"Those who wish to leave must put forward a clear economic case, explaining how being outside the EU will enhance jobs, growth and prosperity in the UK and across Europe. \"The majority - but not all - of CBI members want the UK to remain in a reformed EU,\" she added. Meanwhile, London Mayor Boris Johnson has clarified his position over the idea that a vote to leave the EU could force Brussels to give Britain a better deal over its membership and trigger a second referendum. Mr Johnson had previously suggested that only by voting to leave would the UK \"get the change we need\". But in The Times, Mr Johnson stated categorically: \"Out is out\". The UK will vote on whether to leave or remain in the EU on 23 June. Mr Cameron set the date last weekend after agreeing a deal with fellow EU leaders about a renegotiation of the UK's EU membership.",

He also proposed a hub on the Isle of Grain in Kent or expanding Stansted Airport, but said developing Heathrow would be \"crackers\". The plans will be submitted to the Davies aviation commission by 19 July. Mr Johnson said that a new hub airport would be able to support more than 375,000 new jobs by 2050 and add £742bn to the value of goods and services produced in the UK. He listed the benefits of each airport option as: He also said his proposals would leave the land currently occupied by Heathrow Airport as an \"opportunity\" to create a new town for a population of about 250,000. 'Sheer lunacy' Mr Johnson said: \"Ambitious cities all over the world are already stealing a march on us and putting themselves in a position to eat London's breakfast, lunch and dinner by constructing mega airports. \"For London and the wider UK to remain competitive we have to build an airport capable of emulating that scale of growth.\" But fears have previously been raised about closing Heathrow Airport and the impact it may have on jobs in the area if businesses relocated. Deputy leader of Hounslow Council, Colin Ellar, said: \"Closing Heathrow is sheer lunacy. Boris's plans to solve London's housing crisis and replace the thousands of jobs lost appears to be based on a wing and a prayer. \"We and many sensible commentators don't seriously think Boris Island, wherever it is in the estuary, will ever take off.\" 'Devastate' economy Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said the Thames Estuary airport scheme was a \"pie-in-the-sky plan\" and the mayor should \"stop pitching communities in west London against those in Essex and Kent and back transport solutions that don't wreck our planet\". Leader of Medway Council Rodney Chambers added: \"Boris has failed to listen to the huge number of people who have said that placing an airport in North Kent, on or near the Thames Estuary, is a complete non-starter. \"There are no roads or rail lines there to support an airport that would carry up to 150 million passengers a year, and putting these in place would cost the taxpayer tens of billions of pounds - a needless waste of money.\" He said to \"force\" an airport on Kent would lead to the closure of Heathrow and \"devastate\" the west London economy. And he added that to affect an environmental area, home to 300,000 migrating wildfowl, \"simply beggars belief\". The Davies aviation commission, chaired by ex-Financial Services Authority boss Sir Howard Davies, will consider a number of options to maintain the country's status as an international hub for aviation and will report back in 2015. Later this year, it will also recommend what improvements can be made to improve the use of existing runway capacity for the next five years. A decision on whether to support any of the recommendations contained in the final report will be taken by the government.",

He observed proceedings by video link from Cloverhill Prison in Dublin. The bodies of the 39 people were found in a lorry trailer in Grays last October after it arrived at Purfleet from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. Denying Mr Hughes bail, Mr Justice Paul Burns said that if bail was granted there would be a real risk of him absconding. Earlier this month Maurice Robinson, 25, from Craigavon, County Armagh, pleaded guilty to 39 counts of manslaughter at the Old Bailey. He will be sentenced at a later date. On Wednesday, objecting to bail, Garda (Irish police) Sgt Jim Kirwan told the court that Robinson has told British police that he received £25,000 from Mr Hughes for his involvement in the people smuggling. Sgt Kirwan described Mr Hughes as the ring-leader and organiser of the criminal enterprise for financial gain. The father-of-two estimated his haulage business had a turnover of between €500,000 (£433,000) and €600,000 (£520,000), but said his business was not very profitable. The judge said he found Mr Hughes' claim of a lack of awareness of his financial affairs unconvincing. A further hearing will be held in Dublin on 7 May. In November, as well as the manslaughter admissions, Robinson pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring criminal property. Four other men will stand trial at the Old Bailey in connection with the investigation. Another man, 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, from Mayobridge, County Down, Northern Ireland, is appealing against his extradition from the Republic of Ireland to the UK to face charges related to the Essex lorry discovery.",

The SEND Action group said: \"As in the last lockdown many are being turned away because they are not regarded as vulnerable enough.\" The government said it was prioritising children with special needs. It announced a third lockdown on Monday, with schools being closed except for children deemed \"vulnerable\". This term does not only mean children in care but also those with special educational needs and who have an EHCP (Education, Health and Care Plan). Mother of two Jen Smith, from Bristol, spent two years in a legal battle to get an EHCP in place, as well as an education provision at a specialist school in South Gloucestershire. \"It's a worrying time,\" she said. \"I have a child with an EHCP who already missed most of year seven and eight and it's taking the first term of year nine to get him settled into a new school that could meet his needs. \"Now that we've just gone into lockdown there's no guarantee that he'll get a place.\" She said she was waiting to hear back from her son's school and things were \"up in the air\". \"We live in an overcrowded flat and we don't have the space to really properly do home learning.\" She also felt that nationally, the system for SEND was \"a mess\". \"We have head teachers who are pitted against the government and then parents pitted against the schools and head teachers. \"It feels like a constant ongoing fight.\" For other parents, lockdown has meant more struggles alongside a long-running \"battle\" to secure an EHCP. Those parents have a My Support Plan in place for their child, which is a level below the EHCP. It means the school recognises the child has additional needs but unlike the EHCP, there is no ring-fenced funding in place. Special needs teacher Jennifer Holt, from Huddersfield, says her 10-year-old son is waiting to get a EHCP and is awaiting an autism diagnosis by independent specialists. He has been already diagnosed with severe dyslexia and dyspraxia. She said: \"Not being able to attend for another, probably minimum two months, it's going to make him step back. \"He is so difficult to get engaged in any formal learning, which the school know about. \"He won't get any formal education at all, he won't engage any written work at home, he won't contribute to any Zoom meetings. He shuts down.\" She said his school class size was small so social distancing measures were achievable. \"It's so soul-destroying how much you have to fight for this brilliant little person that you've got, that you know how brilliant they are and other people fail to, or don't want to recognise or support them. \"The feeling of rejection I had was heartbreaking.\" A spokesman for Kirklees Council said: \"Like all local authorities, we are supporting schools to continue to provide the best possible standards of safety, care and education at an incredibly difficult time for schools and families. \"If this particular family would like to contact us, we would be keen to discuss their circumstances.\" While some parents remain in limbo, for others the decision to remain at home has been based on medical grounds. Rumya Kumar, from Swindon, has decided to keep her 13-year old son, who has autism, at home as she has lupus. She kept him home during the national lockdown last March, but his condition deteriorated as a result. \"He is quite happy not to go out, to stay at home with no school. \"But the problem is the more he stays at home, which is his comfort zone, then the harder it gets to send him to school.\" She added that it took him the whole of the winter term to readjust to school. Due to the uncertainty of the pandemic, she said the doctors had to increase his anxiety medication to help him cope. Ms Kumar also hopes to be vaccinated soon so her son can return on a part-time basis. Alice Marshment faced a tense wait for just over a day to see if Bristol City Council would reinstate school transport for her son. It had been temporarily pulled but the council has since confirmed transport would be in place for the the twice-daily two-hour round trip. She said she would have been unable to drive him there, as she also had to home-school her son. \"It feels as though the SEND children, the Cinderella siblings with the education system, have just been forgotten about again,\" she said. \"To be fair, the government hasn't been on top of anything to do with education in this pandemic. \"If we feel that the children generally have been at the bottom of the ladder in terms of the government's concern then SEND children aren't even on the ladder.\" She added that SEND children needed to be prioritised. \"All schools, special schools included, have to find a way to make it work for those children who want to be at school... the government and the local authorities need to work together to make sure that that can happen,\" said Ms Marshment. \"We have very little reserve left to get us through. \"We need this support, it's not an optional extra.\" A SEND action group spokeswoman said: \"In order to close the gap between rhetoric and reality, DfE and the government need to engage with special schools and families of disabled children regarding the particular challenges these schools face and the support required to address them.\" A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"We have prioritised vulnerable children and children with special educational needs and disabilities throughout the pandemic.\" They said they were addressing issues \"urgently\", that \"alternative provision schools remain open\" and that the government would \"publish guidance in due course\".

A request for planning permission has been submitted and it is hoped work could start early next year. Mr Henry said that if that was the case they aimed to have the overhaul completed by October 2014. The project would see the use of adjacent properties to provide better access and facilities. It is hoped the proposal would allow the creation of a specialised rehearsal area, a more welcoming foyer and enhanced bar and food facilities. Another aim of the theatre owners, the Guild of Players, is to expand youth involvement. A funding pledge from the Holywood Trust saved the 18th Century building from potential closure nearly two years ago.

It had rejected a previous bid for the cash, preferring to explore the possibility of a new cultural centre for the town.

            "input": "By Peter BilesBBC World Affairs correspondent He was one of the activists from the African National Congress' armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), formed in 1961 to carry out attacks against government installations. Nearby was a municipal labour office. Four watchmen were on duty, sitting around a fire drinking as they whiled away the night shift. Mr Kasrils' mission was to plant an explosive device against the front door of the building. \"Using a World War II approach, I sandbagged it to get the maximum effect,\" he remembers. \"The timing device was a Heath Robinson affair that involved a condom and a capsule containing sulphuric acid. \"I hung around the centre of town until I heard the sound of the explosion. Then I caught a bus and went home. \"I trembled a lot and I was glad it was over, but I was elated. As I waited for the morning papers, I had a very large glass of whisky to relax.\" The ANC's momentous decision five decades ago to abandon its peaceful resistance to apartheid set South Africa on a new path. Radical Mr Kasrils grew up in Johannesburg. His grandparents had been Jewish immigrants. As a university student in 1960, he was deeply influenced by the Sharpeville massacre, when 69 unarmed protesters were shot dead by the police while taking part in a demonstration against the pass laws. \"I decided I must do something about this dreadful racism. I came into contact with the African National Congress (ANC) and a female cousin also linked me into the South African Communist Party (SACP).\" Both organisations had been outlawed by the white minority government and driven underground. During the course of 1961, as South Africa left the Commonwealth, ANC leaders including Nelson Mandela began to discuss whether they should continue the non-violent struggle or opt for a more radical means of fighting apartheid. By now, Mr Kasrils had moved to Durban where he was establishing himself as a daring-do activist. \"I had been very busy painting slogans on walls and handing out leaflets secretly. One day I was approached by MP Naicker, a member of the Communist Party and the Natal Indian Congress. \"He told me that change was coming, as it was not going to be possible to defeat apartheid by peaceful means. He said the movement needed young people like me.\" 'Complete amateurs' There was still much soul-searching within the ANC about the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), although not for young Mr Kasrils. \"I embraced it all instantly. It seemed absolutely natural to me and I made it clear I'd do everything I could to make a success of it.\" MK's manifesto - published on 16 December 1961 - stated that Umkhonto we Sizwe was a new independent body made up of South Africans of all races. Only later did it come to be accepted as the ANC's armed wing. \"I was introduced to the people who made up the MK Regional Command in the province of Natal,\" says Mr Kasrils. \"Our practical experience was next to nothing. It was drawn from my school science experiments. None of us knew about explosives, but there were people who'd taken part in the Second World War. \"One was Jack Hodgson who'd served in North Africa, so we nicknamed him 'The Desert Rat' when he was sent down from Johannesburg to teach us the basics of bomb making. \"We met in the back room of a safe house to learn the theory, and the live experiments took place in the sugar cane fields. \"We were complete amateurs and we had to do months of training and reconnaissance.\" MK leaders selected 16 December for the first wave of nationwide sabotage attacks. It was an important historical date for white Afrikaners, having been the day when their forebears, the Voortrekkers, fought off Zulu warriors at the Battle of Blood River in 1838. In Durban Mr Kasrils and his colleagues had identified three targets in the city. \"None of our explosives worked very well,\" he reflects. \"Some windows were broken, and at the municipal offices our 'big bomb' only managed to blow the door off its hinges. Nonetheless, the symbolism was there and we felt it was an historic deed for a just cause.\" Mr Kasrils says the young saboteurs worried about the dangers of what they were doing. He says that - in this new method of struggle against apartheid - they took precautions to avoid civilian casualties. Fighting in exile Public opinion was divided when news of the first MK operations spread. Mr Kasrils says the government and the press began to rant about \"terrorism and Communism\", while claiming black South Africans were \"overjoyed\". However, he admits there was still a passionate debate within the Communist Party about the resort to violence. Mr Kasrils' cousin and her husband were among those who insisted that the bombings would not serve the movement well. Umkhonto we Sizwe continued to grow but in 1963 the entire leadership of the MK high command was arrested at a hideout in the Johannesburg suburb of Rivonia. Mr Mandela and other leaders - including Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki and Ahmed Kathrada - were sentenced to life imprisonment. But Mr Kasrils managed to escape the police net and went into exile abroad. Over nearly three decades many young South Africans followed in his footsteps and left the country to undergo further military training. Mr Kasrils, who became known as \"The Red Pimpernel\", remained at the heart of the fight against apartheid. \"The armed struggle was not the only factor that brought change in South Africa but it was one of the elements that eventually helped to force the white government to see reality and open the way to negotiations and democracy,\" he said.

We are confused,\" he told the BBC. \"Our family here are desperate. My father, mother and sisters are crying their eyes out.\" He added that the family \"paid a lot of money\" to get to the UK. Analysis: The much-travelled route from Iran by Jiyar Gol, BBC international affairs correspondent Shiva and Rasoul were two of thousands of Iranian-Kurdish refugees that every year put the lives of their families in the hands of smugglers and go to Europe. The Kurdish region in Iran has faced both political persecution and economic disparity. Rasoul's friend, a refugee in Dunkirk, told me in a phone call the family left Iran on 7 August for Turkey, then took a ferry to Italy and then drove to France almost a month ago. They paid €24,000 (about £21,600) to the smugglers. Rasoul's brother in the Kurdish city of Sardasht in Western Iran, said his brother sold everything to save his life and seek a better future for his family. Four bodies lie in a hospital in Dunkirk, but 15-month-old Artin is still missing. The French coastguard confirmed searches at sea for any further people from the boat did not resume on Wednesday. Conditions in the English Channel had been rough early on Tuesday and the boat was spotted about 2km (1.2 miles) off the French coast by a passing sailing boat at about 09:30 local time, which alerted French authorities. Four French vessels, one Belgian helicopter and a French fishing boat took part in the rescue and a search operation. But by the time rescue teams reached the struggling boat, it had already sunk. At a camp in Dunkirk, another refugee, Bilal Gaf, said the family had stayed close to his tent for three or four days before they left, and described Artin as \"famous\" among those staying there. \"He was a very happy baby,\" he said, showing photographs of himself with the baby, taken around 10 days earlier. \"People are sad, but what can we do? Nothing. Just cry.\" He said the family's deaths may deter some people from crossing the Channel. But he said that many, including himself, will \"never give up\" on getting to the UK - even by dangerous means. A 20-year-old man living at the same camp, who did not want to be identified, said: \"I'm feeling frustrated, angry and heartbroken. My heart is really broken because of this family. \"I used to know the family, I played with the kids.\" Asked about why they would risk such a journey, the man - who said he was from the same city in Iran as the family, where Kurdish people have been persecuted - said: \"They had to. They really had to. They were frustrated here. They couldn't apply for asylum anywhere else. \"They had family in the UK - I think the father had a brother there.\" There are literally hundreds of thousands of refugees in camps or living rough trying to escape to Europe. The UK is seeing only a tiny fraction of those. Other European countries are seeing and accepting many more asylum seekers. But why cross a continent and the Channel to come to Britain at all? There are a number of factors. For colonial and historical reasons, as there are communities in the UK from every corner of the world. Many migrants have family or friends they can connect with. Another reason is that English is an international language and taught in schools around the world. That makes Britain attractive. And some are motivated by what the people smugglers tell them. They are known to lie about what life is like in the UK and to create a false sense of urgency, telling refugees to \"go now, before the rules change\". The UK does offer protection to around 20,000 refugees a year, but Covid-19 has suspended official routes from camps in Syria and other UN camps. Charity Care4Calais said the \"loss of life should be a wake-up call for those in power in France and the UK\". It said creating a new system that would allow asylum seekers to apply for refuge in the UK from outside its borders would \"put an end to terrifying, dangerous sea crossings and stop tragedy striking again\". Save The Children called for a \"joint plan\" from London and Paris to ensure the safety of vulnerable families, adding: \"The English Channel must not become a graveyard for children.\" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with the victims' loved ones. \"We have offered the French authorities every support as they investigate this terrible incident, and will do all we can to crack down on the ruthless criminal gangs who prey on vulnerable people by facilitating these dangerous journeys,\" he added. Between 25 and 35 million Kurds inhabit a mountainous region straddling the borders of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia. They form a distinctive community, united through race, culture and language, even though they have no standard dialect. Kurds also adhere to a number of different religions and creeds, although the majority are Sunni Muslims. They make up the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East, but they have never obtained a permanent nation state.",

            "input": "By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Every night bank IT systems process the day's business, bringing all account balances and transaction information up to date. The different processes, which include counter transactions and making changes to standing orders, are referred to as \"batch jobs\". Each batch job performs a specific task within the bank's systems and needs to be run in the correct logical sequence, relative to the others. A \"batch scheduler\" is the software that executes the sequence. On Sunday 17 June 2012, the software shared by Ulster Bank and the Nat West bank was upgraded. The following day problems began to emerge - long response times and failures were occurring. By the Tuesday, the fateful decision was made to reverse the upgrade. But the upgrade had reformatted the data in the batch jobs and the older software now could not read the data. Red alert This meant transactions could not be processed and a \"major red\" alert was initiated by RBS. IT staff focussed on manually reloading the batch jobs. By the morning of Wednesday 20 June 2012, the NatWest batch was largely completed and account balances were up to date for the coming day, albeit more than four hours later than usual. However, for Ulster Bank it was a different story. It started the business day on the Wednesday with a significant backlog to batch processing. By the Thursday, things became much worse - one day's batch started processing before the other day's was finished. The two batches interfered with each other causing additional problems and further backlogs. This snowball effect meant that it took until 10 July to solve the Ulster Bank problem while the Nat West situation had been largely fixed by 25 June. RBS has now changed IT processes so that each of its brands now has its own dedicated batch scheduler. Within Ulster Bank, the Northern Ireland business and the Republic of Ireland business also have separate schedulers. All this mean should mean if there is a problem in the future it can be fixed much more quickly.",

Access to Wikipedia has been blocked in Turkey since April 2017. Officials said at the time that \"an administrative measure\" had been taken, but gave no reason for the ban. Turkish media said authorities had asked Wikipedia to remove content by writers \"supporting terror\". \"We are taking this action as part of our continued commitment to knowledge and freedom of expression as fundamental rights for every person,\" the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organisation which runs Wikipedia, said in a statement. \"We are doing so only after continued and exhaustive attempts to lift the block through legal action in the Turkish courts, good faith conversations with the Turkish authorities, and campaigns to raise awareness of the block and its impact on Turkey and the rest of the world.\" Routinely ignored More than two years on, it still happens: I do a quick internet search on a topic, which leads to a Wikipedia link. I click on it, without thinking. Error 404: Page not found. Ah yes, a country aiming to join the European Union has banned a free encyclopaedia website. Turks have found ways to circumnavigate the block, using \"mirror\" Wikipedia URLs or Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to change their IP location. But it's still a hindrance to many. Ankara complained about the content of two articles: on the Syrian war and on state-sponsored terrorism, demanding they be removed. In meetings with the Turkish authorities, Wikipedia bosses explained that articles could be edited - and that removing them contravened values of democratising knowledge. Referral to the ECHR, Wikipedia told me, sends an important message on free speech. But the court has ruled against Turkey more than any other country - and Ankara routinely ignores verdicts, paying fines instead. This one could go the same way. Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, said the site would keep pressing its case. Turkey has temporarily blocked social media sites including Facebook and Twitter in the past, usually following protests or terrorist attacks. Prior to the ban, more than 300,000 articles had been published in Turkish on the Wikipedia site.

Mr Margerie, 63, chief executive of the French oil firm, was killed in the crash along with three crew members. Russian investigators have alleged that the driver of the snowplough was drunk at the time, but his family has denied this. The Russian authorities have launched a criminal investigation. Mr Martynenko, 60, was detained after the crash, which took place in poor weather at Vnukovo airport, south-west of Moscow, at around midnight on Monday. His family insisted he was not drunk. \"My client has chronic heart disease, he doesn't drink at all,\" his lawyer Alexander Karabanov told Interfax news agency. \"When I lost my bearings I did not notice when I drove out on to the runway,\" Mr Martynenko told Russia's Channel One TV. \"The plane was preparing to take off, and I practically didn't see it or hear it because the machine was running. I didn't even see the lights, I did not see a thing, and then the crash happened.\" Although there had been snow in Moscow, it was not thought to be lying thick on the ground when the Dassault Falcon plane clipped the snowplough and burst into flames. Christophe de Margerie was one of France's leading industrialists and was returning to Paris, reportedly after a meeting on foreign investment with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at his country residence outside Moscow. Total announced on Wednesday that his job would be taken over by Philippe Pouyanne, the current head of the company's refining and chemicals division. Thierry Desmarest, who served as chairman and chief executive from 1995-2007, will become Total's chairman until the end of 2015, when Mr Pouyanne will take on both posts. Mr de Margerie's trademark grey handlebar earned him the nickname \"Big Moustache\", and his was one of the most recognisable faces of the global oil industry. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said he was an extraordinary business leader while President Francois Hollande praised his \"independent character and original personality\". More recently, he had become an outspoken critic of European sanctions against Russia, arguing that such actions would simply push Russia closer to China. Total, France's second-largest listed company, is one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia and is planning to double its output from the country by 2020. Despite the sanctions, it has continued work on a liquefied natural gas project with Russian firm Novatek to tap vast natural gas reserves in north-western Siberia and it signed a deal in May with Lukoil to develop shale oil in western Siberia. Investigators began looking at the plane's flight voice and data recorders on Wednesday, Ria Novosti reports. French investigators arrived in Moscow late on Tuesday to take part in the inquiry. The role of air traffic controllers is likely to be part of the investigation. Pictures from the scene show the driver of the snowplough looking shocked but walking unaided and without any obvious serious injury.",

Milton Keynes Council's conservation officer shared Historic England's concerns and said the scheme should only be approved \"if public benefit outweighs the harm\".

When Milton Keynes was designated as a new town in 1967, planning guidance stated no building was allowed to be taller than the tallest tree. This was later changed by what was then the Milton Keynes Partnership which decided the town needed \"landmark buildings\" and raised the height limit. The original plans for Hotel La Tour requested approval for an 18-storey hotel, but this was reduced to 14 following consultation. Plans for the 14-storey version include a rooftop bar and restaurant, conference rooms, leisure facilities and a public viewing area with art installation on the top floor - to be known as \"SeeMK\".

The air station in Fife has a quick reaction alert (QRA) role which involves intercepting suspicious aircraft. The RAF described the appearance of the Russian Bears as \"routine\". Similar incidents have occurred in the past. In March 2010, two Tu-160 Blackjacks were shadowed by two F3 Tornados from Leuchars after they appeared off the Western Isles. And in 2007, Tornado jets intercepted two Tu-95s spotted observing a Royal Navy exercise off the islands. Three years ago, elements of Russia's Baltic Fleet gathered 30 miles (48km) off the Moray Firth to shelter from bad weather. Speaking about Wednesday's encounter, Flt Lt Montgomery said: \"We monitored their progress, including handing them over to Danish F-16 QRA aircraft as the Bears flew towards Denmark, then continued to monitor them as they returned and then departed towards Norwegian airspace.\" The RAF Typhoon pilot added: \"Intercepting Russian Bear aircraft is a routine occurrence for us, it's what we do to maintain UK sovereign airspace.\" The MoD said similar incidents happened eight times during 2013.

Mr Bouteflika was an 81-year-old veteran of the Algerian independence struggle, but he was in very poor health and had not been seen in public for a long time. When he resigned he handed power to a military-backed caretaker government, but protesters continued to call for a return to a civilian democracy, and the departure of the old guard officials associated with the Bouteflika administration.

Now she will face the challenge of remaining faithful to his legacy - which PSB officials are determined to hold her to - while staying true to her own ideals. Ms Silva opposed some of Mr Campos's alliances with regional candidates - especially when they were members of the country's powerful agribusiness lobby, which accounts for over one fifth of Brazil's GDP. Having locked horns with the sector during her time as environment minister, she may now have to reach a compromise with its backers. Humble beginnings Ms Silva was born into a family of 11 children in the northern state of Acre, in the heart of the Amazon. As a child she would walk several miles in the forest with her father and siblings every day to collect rubber from trees. She campaigned alongside the rubber tapper and trade union leader Chico Mendes, who was killed in 1988 for his activism. Throughout her childhood years, she was seriously ill a number of times - suffering from hepatitis, malaria and contamination by heavy metals. As a result she suffers from frail health and has an intolerance to a long list of things - such as cosmetics, perfume, alcoholic beverages and red meat. This and her devout evangelism have marked her style. She uses no make-up and prefers simple and sober clothing, mainly long dresses. She often wears her hair in a tight bun tied by a thin braid. It is a stern image, but according to political scientist Ricardo Ismael she also conveys personal warmth. \"She inspires confidence in ordinary voters - that she is accessible,\" explains Mr Ismael, who is a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio. \"Wherever she goes, she approaches people and allows herself to be approached. She seems frail but conveys remarkable strength. \"She knows Brazil. She knows the problems from seeing them on the streets, or living them,\" he adds. Educational success Aged 16, Ms Silva left her community of rubber workers in Bagaco and moved to Rio Branco, the capital of Acre, to study and get treatment for hepatitis. She was taken in by nuns in a convent and became the first person in her family to learn how to read and write. \"When I saw my name on the list of people that had passed the course, I knelt down and gave thanks to God. That list saying I was literate opened doors for me,\" she said in an interview with BBC Brasil years later. After she left the convent, she went to work as a domestic maid in exchange for lodging. Ms Silva was widely praised on an international level for her work as environment minister under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. During those five years, hundreds were arrested for crimes against the environment, a record area of territory was set aside as indigenous reserves and there was a significant slowdown in rainforest deforestation rates. But she also faced defeats such as the approval of the first genetically modified soybean crops, which she had opposed. Fearing her agenda was losing ground, she resigned in 2008 and a year later left the governing Workers' Party. Agenda of change Opinion polls conducted following last year's wave of protests against World Cup spending, corruption and poor public services suggested Ms Silva was the only politician whose image had benefitted from the unrest. Political scientist David Fleischer of the University of Brasilia says she appeals to the younger generation and those who want change. \"Those who took to the streets saying they didn't feel represented by Brazil's political system were still undecided, and now many will choose to vote for her\", he says. However, some of those critical of the bigger establishment parties are also uneasy about Ms Silva's devout religious views, fearing she is too conservative on social issues such as gay marriage and abortion. Even though the protests have diminished, her supporters believe there is still a yearning for change. They hope that the desire for change along with the emotional circumstances of her selection will result in a powerful boost to her campaign just weeks ahead of the election.",

            "input": "It is one a set of objectives the BBC Trust gave director general Tony Hall in July, which were made public for the first time today. The targets were published as part of a review into how the BBC is governed, following what the trust called \"a number of significant failures\". Several changes will be made to make the BBC more \"accountable and transparent\". The BBC Trust will regularly publish the objectives it sets for Lord Hall from now on. It said the \"quality, variety and originality of new drama on BBC One\" should be one of his \"immediate priorities\", especially in peak time. BBC One has recently enjoyed success with Doctor Who and Last Tango in Halifax. However, other dramas such as The White Queen and Ripper Street - which was cancelled last week - have not done so well. The \"quality and prominence\" of BBC One and BBC Two's current affairs coverage was another key area where Lord Hall was encouraged to \"achieve new peaks of distinctiveness\" by looking at the \"creative culture\" in TV management and commissioning. The governance review was launched in September following \"a year of difficult events at the BBC\". They included revelations about late presenter Jimmy Savile, multi-million pound pay-offs to senior management and the corporation's failed Digital Media Initiative (DMI), which wasted almost £100m. 'Sensible changes' The review's key conclusion is that there has been \"confusion about who is responsible for what in certain key operational areas and this has undermined confidence in the governance and operation of the BBC\". BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten said he and Lord Hall had now agreed some \"sensible changes\" to the working relationship between the Trust and the BBC Executive, to make things clearer in terms of their roles and responsibilities. There will now be new three-stage performance reporting, to ensure better monitoring of specific BBC projects. It will enable issues to be identified and dealt with early - unlike the DMI project, which was supposed to modernise the BBC's video production and archive systems, but which collapsed after five years, at a cost of £98.4m. The BBC's Executive Board, which is responsible for making decisions, will now have to report to the Trust more often and more comprehensively throughout the year, so that the trust can assess how it is doing. Some of these meetings will be filmed and broadcast on the trust website, including end of year discussions about the corporation's performance. The trust will also ask licence fee payers to help set the priorities for the BBC each year, but it will no longer involve itself in operational decision making. \"This is an important first step in making the BBC simpler and better run,\" said Lord Hall of the changes, which come into effect from 1 April, 2014. Value for money The BBC has also appointed former Sony chairman and CEO, Sir Sir Howard Stringer, to strengthen the team and bring his \"extensive broadcasting and commercial experience\" to the BBC Executive Board from 1 January, as one of two new Non-Executive Directors. \"People don't just expect the BBC to produce great programmes, they want it to be run well,\" said Lord Patten. \"While much has gone well in the past, the last 15 months have seen a number of significant failures. [These changes mean] the BBC can get on with the job of running the BBC, and the Trust can rightly focus on holding the Executive to account on behalf of licence fee payers.\" One of the other objectives laid out by the Trust, and originally sent to Lord Hall in July, is that \"BBC managers need to spend public money as if it is their own money\". In an effort to improve the value for money provided to licence fee payers, the BBC is also tasked with providing \"a clear and sustainable response to the NAO's review on severance payments, to make sure we put a stop to any future excessive payments\". Lord Hall announced within his first few weeks in the job that he would put a £150,000 cap on pay-offs for senior managers. Other objectives include pursuing new creative partnerships with other major cultural organisations and institutions and responding to the general issues revealed by the Pollard report. It looked into what went wrong in the reporting of Jimmy Savile allegations and why a Newsnight investigation was dropped by the BBC.",

A 24-year-old man was arrested on Friday following a manhunt and later charged with offences including murder. He is expected in court on Saturday. Police in New Zealand do not normally carry guns, and it is rare for officers to be killed in the line of duty. According to the police, the last incident was in May 2009, when a senior constable was shot at a house in Napier while carrying out a routine search warrant. What happened in the shooting? At 10:28, police saw a \"vehicle of interest\" in Massey, west Auckland, and attempted to stop it. \"Lights and sirens were activated and police attempted to follow the vehicle,\" said Police Commissioner Andrew Coster. \"However, the officers quickly lost sight of it.\" A short time later, the vehicle was found \"crashed into another vehicle\". A member of the public suffered serious injuries - police originally said the injuries were not serious. As officers approached the vehicle, a man got out, armed with a \"long-barrelled firearm\". \"The offender has then fired multiple shots at the two police officers at the scene,\" Mr Coster said. \"Both officers have been shot and tragically, one of our officers has been killed.\" Police later named the officer who died as 28-year-old Constable Matthew Dennis Hunt. In a statement, his family said being a police officer had been \"his life-long dream\". Police said that, after the shooting, the suspect got into another vehicle, a silver Mazda, and fled the scene. The vehicle was later found abandoned. One witness told the NZ Herald he saw an injured officer jumping over a fence. \"He dropped to the ground and was looking around a bit, clutching his chest,\" the man said. \"Then he jumped over the fence and ran off up the street.\" How did the manhunt unfold? Armed police raided a house about four hours after the shooting and arrested two \"persons of interest\". A firearm was found. A 24-year-old man was subsequently charged. However, the investigation was continuing and police have not ruled out charging other people over the incident, Mr Coster said. \"This is a shocking situation. It is the worst news that police and police officers' families can ever receive in the course of what we do,\" he said. What was the reaction? \"The incident points to the real risk that our officers face as they go about their jobs every day,\" said Mr Coster. He confirmed the officers were not armed at the time. \"At this stage there is nothing to indicate that this job was going to be anything out of the ordinary.\" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern offered her condolences to the officer's family and police colleagues. \"Our police officers work hard every day to keep us and our communities safe,\" she said. Only this month, New Zealand Police said a six-month trial of \"armed response teams\" would not continue. \"I want to reiterate that I am committed to New Zealand Police remaining a generally unarmed police service,\" said Mr Coster. \"How the public feels is important - we police with the consent of the public, and that is a privilege.\"",

A tweet from Kensington Palace said the baby would be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge (pronounced Lou-ee, not Lou-iss). The new prince is fifth in line to the throne. Louis is one of the middle names of Prince William and of the new prince's brother, George. It was also the first name of Lord Mountbatten - his great-great-great uncle - who was killed by the IRA in 1979. Lord Mountbatten had a strong influence in the upbringing of great-nephew Prince Charles and was described by the latter as \"the grandfather I never had\". Arthur is also one of the duke's middle names, and was a middle name of King George VI - the Queen's father. 'A family favourite' By Sarah Campbell, BBC royal correspondent The pool of names considered suitable for a prince is not large and yet, the wait between birth and public naming suggests there was some indecision about what to call the new baby. It did give punters four days to place their bets, though - and most of them will be disappointed. Louis certainly wasn't the front-runner as far as the bookies were concerned, but it is clearly a family favourite. William and George both have it as a middle name. But with its French and German origins, it will no doubt generate some eyebrow-raising, Brexit-related comment. There will also no doubt be some confusion over the pronunciation (Loo-ee not Loo-iss). What is certain is that we are unlikely to see much of Prince Louis of Cambridge in the coming months and years. His parents remain determined to bring up all three of their children away from the public's gaze as much as is possible. Bookmakers had Arthur as the favourite name for the prince, followed by James and Philip. Historian Judith Rowbotham said Louis is \"not a traditional Windsor name\" and a \"little surprising\" - but said it was still a safe choice for the royals. \"It's very much an acknowledgement of a wider heritage,\" Dr Rowbotham said, adding that it is also \"very much an affectionate tribute\" to the Prince of Wales, who was \"deeply devoted\" to Lord Mountbatten. Former One Direction star Louis Tomlinson tweeted: \"Young Louis welcome to the world. I'll take you under my wing lad. The Adidas tracksuit is in the post!\" Louis is the 71st most popular name for a boy in England and Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The name was 38th out of the top 100 baby names for boys in 2004 but has been declining in popularity. In 2016, 911 newborn boys were named Louis by their parents compared to more than 5,000 who were named George. You may also like: On Thursday evening, Prince William told reporters that they were still deciding on a name, saying: \"I'm working on that.\" Earlier in the week, he said Catherine and the baby were \"in good form, luckily\", and added: \"Sleeping's going reasonably well so far, so he's behaving himself, which is good news.\"",

Lekima made landfall in the early hours of Saturday in Wenling, between Taiwan and China's financial capital Shanghai, packing strong winds and heavy rain. It was moving further north up the east coast on Sunday. Most of the deaths were in the city of Wenzhou where torrential downpours caused a landslide, state media said. The landslide occurred after a barrier lake - or natural dam - formed, pooling water from the heavy rains before collapsing. Emergency crews battled to save stranded motorists from floods and searched for survivors in the rubble of damaged buildings. In Zhejiang province, Lekima damaged crops and 34,000 houses. The direct economic loss amounts to 14.57 billion yuan (£1.7 billion), state media said. Footage on Sunday from state broadcaster CCTV showed rescue workers on boats in Linhai city where streets were completely submerged in water. Lekima has now passed over Shanghai and is expected to hit Shandong province later on Sunday. Shanghai evacuated some 250,000 residents. More than 3,200 flights have been cancelled due to the typhoon with Shanghai, Beijing and other cities grounding planes. Lekima is the ninth typhoon to hit China so far this year. Weather experts quoted by Xinhua news agency said it was among the top three strongest typhoons to have ever hit Zhejiang. It was initially given China's highest level of weather warning but was later downgraded to an \"orange\" level. Chinese weather forecasters said the storm, which had winds of 187km/h (116mph) when it made landfall, was moving north at 15km/h. It earlier passed Taiwan, skirting its northern tip and causing a handful of injuries and some property damage. Lekima is one of two typhoons in the western Pacific at the moment. Further east, Typhoon Krosa is spreading heavy rain across the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam. It is moving north-west and could strike Japan some time next week, forecasters said.",

He told the BBC that the refugees \"risk death\" from anti-balaka militias. The UN's humanitarian chief warned last week of possible genocide. Stephen O'Brien said that violence in CAR was escalating and the situation was becoming dire. \"Violence is intensifying, risking a repeat of the devastating destructive crisis that gripped the country four years ago,\" he said. Mr O'Brien added: \"The early warning signs of genocide are there. We must act now.\" CAR has experienced sectarian violence since 2013, when the largely Muslim Seleka rebels seized power, and were accused of killing non-Muslim civilians. The anti-balaka \"self-defence\" groups were then formed but have also been accused of atrocities. Balaka is a street name which means bullets and the militia's name therefore translates to \"those who stop bullets\". Seleka, on the other hand, means \"coalition\" in the widely-spoken Sango language. According to the UN, thousands have been killed and at least a million people have been displaced in CAR since 2013. It also says that at least half of the population is dependent on humanitarian aid. A tenuous peace deal signed in June saw 13 out of 14 armed groups operating in the country agree with the government to end fighting in exchange for political representation and the integration of armed militias into the military. Bishop Munoz says that the refugees sought help at the seminary after fighting broke out in May, and have since been under the care of the church and aid organisations. \"Nearby, there are anti-Balaka militias who prevent them from going out to search for food, water or firewood,\" he said. \"So they are completely confined inside the seminary. They would risk death if they venture out,\" he told the BBC's Newsday programme. Protecting the vulnerable A 10-year-old boy who was caught up in the violent clashes told a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) aid worker that he was shot at. \"People fired shots. One of my brothers received a bullet in his heart. Another brother got a bullet in his chest. I also received one in my testicle,\" he said. A doctor with MSF, Ernest Lualuali Ibongu, told the BBC that there are other people in the seminary who need medical care but who cannot leave the compound to get to a hospital. Bishop Munoz said that the refugees needed to be relocated because many aid organisations have stopped working in the area. He said that attempts to appeal to the militia to allow aid workers in had failed. \"The anti-Balaka are armed and very violent and capable of killing children,\" he said. \"It is very difficult to reason with [them].\" He says that both anti-Balaka and Seleka militias have attacked the church's properties, but adds that it is determined to protect vulnerable people from both sides. \"For us, there's no such thing as a Muslim person or a Christian person, everyone is a human being. We need to protect those who are vulnerable.\" Correction 2 September 2017: An earlier version of this story carried an image of milita in Gambo (taken by Alexis Huguet, AFP/Getty) which we incorrectly captioned as being militia camped outside the seminary in Bangassou.",

The first-born son of the late president was nicknamed \"Fidelito\", or Little Fidel, after his father. He was a nuclear physicist, trained by the former Soviet Union. \"Fidel Castro Díaz-Balart, who had been treated by a group of doctors for several months due to deep depression, took his life this morning,\" Cuba's official newspaper Granma reported - little more than a year after the death of his father. State television said he had been receiving medical treatment as an outpatient in recent months, following a hospital stay. Depression in the spotlight - Will Grant, BBC News, Havana Fidel Ángel Castro Díaz-Balart had taken his own life after suffering with deep depression which doctors had been treating him for over several months, state TV said. As much as the death itself may shock ordinary Cubans, it was those unexpected circumstances which caught them by surprise. As the personal lives of members of the Castro family are generally kept away from the public eye, almost no-one will have known he suffered mental health issues prior to the announcement of his death. Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? At the time of his death, he was a scientific adviser for the Cuban Council of State and he served as vice president of Cuba's Academy of Sciences. He headed the island's nuclear programme from 1980 to 1992, before it was suspended after the Soviet Union's collapse. He was married to María Victoria Barreiro and had three children from his previous marriage - Fidel Antonio Castro Smirnov, Mirta María Castro Smirnova and Jos­é Raúl Castro Smirnov. Fidel Castro Díaz-Balart was born in 1949, during his father's brief first marriage to Mirta Díaz-Balart, the daughter of a prominent pre-revolution politician. His father went on to overthrow the US-backed dictator, Fulgencio Batista, in 1959 - when his mother's family fled the island and went to Florida. His parents divorced and \"Fidelito\" spent some of his early years in the US before his father managed to bring him back to Cuba. This history explains why some of his close maternal relatives are among the most committed critics of the Cuban government - such as his cousin, Mario Díaz-Balart, a US congressman. Fidelito himself was loyal to the ideals of the Cuban revolution, but was said in recent years to have grown weary - both of living in his father's shadow and having been sidelined from Cuban decision-making on energy resources, said reports. His ideas for developing renewable energy on the island were not incorporated into state policy, an academic colleague, Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, told Reuters. \"I imagine that was disappointing for him,\" Mr Benjamin-Alvarado said. The TV announcement said his funeral would be planned by his family, but no further details were given. His father, Fidel Castro, a revolutionary figure and one of the world's longest serving political leaders, died aged 90 in 2016.",

In games like the Wolfenstein series, German editions would change Hitler's name, remove his moustache, and replace swastikas with another shape. The change means Nazi symbols used in an artistic way will be allowed. Until now, using banned symbols would prevent a video game from being considered for a compulsory age rating - essentially banning it from being sold in stores. The ban on extremist symbols is still in place, but rating body USK said the rules will now be applied to video games in the same way they are used for films. On a case-by-case basis, a game could get past the rating procedure if an artistic or dramatic use is justified. It also said a game which is clearly opposed to the banned group's ideals could qualify - which is the case for many games that require large numbers of Nazi soldiers to be killed by the player. Shaving Hitler The ban on Nazi symbols in games dates back to the 1990s. One recent controversy involved blockbuster game Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, set in an alternate history in which Nazi Germany won World War Two - and in which Hitler is still alive. The German version of the game replaced every swastika with the game's logo or other inoffensive symbols. In most countries, when Hitler's character enters a scene, he is welcomed as the Führer - but in Germany, he is referred to as a \"chancellor\" - and his recognisable moustache has mysteriously disappeared. The video showcasing his appearance contains graphic violence and may not be suitable for all viewers. Those changes were needed to put the game on sale at all in Germany - but the intended meaning was still clear, and the censorship was ridiculed both in Germany and worldwide. The next game in the series, Wolfenstein Youngblood, was unveiled in June - with a German-language trailer that replaced all its swastikas with another geometric shape. It's not yet clear if Bethesda, the game's developer, will try to submit an uncensored version of the game for the German market. But Bethesda's Nazi-fighting series isn't the only game to have run into problems with the German censors. The developers of the TV-tie-in South Park: The Stick of Truth faced a problem with their Nazi zombie characters - and chose to cover the symbols with crudely-drawn black boxes, sticking to the rules while making fun of them at the same time. Aside from the banned symbols, German games are often far less violent than their counterparts in other European countries. Blood is often toned down, bodies have a tendency to disappear, and sometimes human characters are turned into robots for German editions - since \"killing\" robots is viewed as a less violent act. Other countries also censor violent or sexual content - notably Australia, which has rejected several major titles in recent years unless changes were made. They include South Park, which replaced its sexual scenes with an image of a crying koala and a written explanation of what the scene could have contained; and the Witcher 2, which was only released after sex scenes were edited.",

            "input": "By Nick BourneBBC News It was only decades later she read about the murder of two girls in a Welsh town and then she remembered she had seen one of their photos before. Her aunt, Freda Burnell, was eight when she was killed by Harold Jones, 15, in Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, in February 1921, along with Florrie Little, 11. Their graves have just been restored. \"Freda was sent on an errand by her father to buy some food for the chickens and she never returned,\" said Mrs Swift, who attended a special memorial and rededication service in Abertillery on Saturday. Mrs Swift, from Hawarden, Flintshire, said she does not know why neither her mother nor grandmother ever mentioned Freda, even though her photograph was on her grandmother's fireplace. But she finally learnt about the murders in a book written by local author Neil Milkins after she was told about its publication by her sister in 2011. \"It was never mentioned by my mother or my grandmother. Freda was murdered when my mother was five and Freda was eight and a half,\" she said. \"Fast forward to 2011 when I was first told about the book and [then] I realised that it was my mother's sister.\" Freda went missing on 5 February and was found dead the next morning in an alley. Shop worker Jones was arrested the following week and charged with murder but he denied the charges and was acquitted at his trial on 21 June. Just 17 days later, he went on to murder Florrie, his neighbour, at his home where he concealed her body in the attic. He was arrested and went on to admit both murders and was jailed. He was eventually released on parole in 1941. He died in 1971. Mrs Swift has been keen for her aunt to be remembered within her family since finding out about her story. \"It is only one generation from me and I feel I should keep her name in people's minds and my family's mind,\" she said. Last year, a campaign was set up to fund the restoration of the girls' graves. And on Saturday they will be rededicated with a memorial service officiated by Mr Milkins, the author of the book, Every Mother's Nightmare, Abertillery in Mourning. He helped coordinate the restoration appeal with trustees Gill Clark and Julie Holt, raising £4,000 locally, much like the appeal to pay for the girls' funerals following their deaths. Mr Milkins explained that thousands of people attended the funerals as the community was so shocked by their deaths. But, over time, the graves had become a \"terrible mess\" which prompted him to take action, especially as he was taking family descendants to Brynithel Cemetery to see them, many for the first time. Mrs Swift became the custodian of Freda's grave as it had been in her late grandparents' names, and that allowed fourth generation stonemason Dan Edwards to start restoring it. His great grandfather had created Florrie's original headstone. Mrs Swift said she expected Saturday to be an emotional day. \"The first funeral and the gravestones were paid for by contributions from the town of Abertillery and it's the same way now for the restoration being paid for by donations, for which I'm very thankful,\" she said. The memorial service took place at The Metropole theatre in Abertillery followed by a ceremony at the cemetery.",

            "input": "By Suzanne BearneBusiness reporter Richard Conway says that many people were not convinced by his idea for \"virtual nannies\" - whereby the childminder is on the other end of a Zoom call. \"A lot of people thought it was a crazy idea, and that it involved leaving the child home alone,\" says the founder of Childcare.co.uk. Instead the service is designed so that mum or dad can get some work done at home, while someone else, via a computer screen, keeps the kids occupied. The child must be aged at least two for parents to use the service. \"Younger children need a bit of entertainment, and if parents are working they can't always give them the time they need,\" adds Mr Conway. \"So we thought having a virtual nanny, who is a real nanny, by video would be a great solution.\" Earlier this year, Thea Herodotou, 37, a senior lecturer in London, arranged for a virtual nanny to look after her daughter Zoe, aged five. With Zoe's nursery closed during the first lockdown, Thea says it was \"unmanageable\" juggling parenting and working from home. \"My husband and I would take frequent breaks with Zoe, and entertain her, but it was stressful.\" So they booked Antoinette Wood, an Ofsted registered professional nanny, for an hour a day. It took Zoe a few sessions to settle, says Thea. \"My daughter would run out of the room [to begin with]. However, Zoe slowly got used to the daily session and I was able to leave them in the room.\" Antoinette says the sessions work if they are \"carried out for an hour at a time, especially as young children have short attention spans\". \"I am a great planner, so I prepared a lesson plan of how Zoe and I would spend our virtual hour together each day,\" she says. \"I also sent her a list of items such as paper, pencils, crayons, scissors, dice and a drink of water that she would need during this hour. \"The hour session consists of a little hello and chat, story time, singing rhymes and counting, games, music and movement. The hour is led by the child, and each day we finish our session with dancing around the living room to a well-known song.\" New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. Richard Conway says there are now more than 4,000 virtual nannies available via his website, and that more than 50,000 parents have made enquiries about the service. However, it is safe to say that the idea of someone looking after your kids from the other end of a video call will not be for every mum and dad. Parenting expert Sarah Ockwell-Smith, author of The Gentle Parenting Book, says it is not a substitute for in-person human interaction. \"Children in particular really struggle with living life through a screen,\" she says. \"The separation from friends and relatives, who they would normally see often, but can now only view through a screen, and moving all social interaction and classes online, I think has created a bit of a ticking time bomb. \"This isn't how we are meant to live, and I do think we are going to see a lasting impact on this generation of children as they grow up.\" For parents who want a babysitter who will be physically present, there are apps such as Bubble, which has more than 20,000 on its books. Ranging from students to nannies, each has to go through a verification process. This includes identity and reference confirmations, and a DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check, which sees if a person has a criminal record. Each individual signed up is then also reviewed by parents. Mum Sri Nujella used the app back in March to book a 19-year-old student to look after her daughter Ishi, who is three. A project manager, Sri says she needed help because she was just three days into a new job when Ishi's nursery had to close. At the same time, her husband was away in India with work. \"My job demanded a lot of attention,\" she says. \"I was desperate to find childcare.\" So she used Bubble to book cover for half a day, Monday to Friday, for a month. Ari Last, the chief executive of Bubble, says there has been a big change in how the service has been used this year. \"Pre-Covid, parents were booking babysitters for evenings, but now that's been replaced by daytime. Working from home with kids is impossible, and parents are using Bubble for when they have an important video conference, or just to watch their kids while they work.\" Another tech firm trying to increase childcare options is website and app Tiney. The platform allows people to train to become childminders and set up nurseries in their own homes. They receive advice on how to run their business, including support regarding insurance, payments, lesson plans, health and safety, and communication with parents. Tiney says it has had 7,000 applications from people wanting to retrain as childminders since the start of the first nationwide lockdown. These include people who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic, and former teachers and nursery staff who want to run their own businesses. When a parent pays for a childcare place via the app, Tiney keeps 10% of those funds. Childminders have to stay with the company for a minimum of two years. \"There is a massive shortage of childcare,\" says Tiney boss Brett Wigdortz, who also founded educational charity Teach First, which aims to help improve the school performance of students from low-income backgrounds. \"The whole childcare sector isn't working now. We're trying to make childminding run like a nursery, with simple contracts and invoices through the app.\" Mr Wigdortz adds, to the hopeful ear of many stressed-out parents: \"Technology makes everyone's life easier.\"",

Five others have already been convicted of the same charges after 12 shots were fired at police in August. The West Midlands force helicopter was also shot at. Tyrone Laidley, 20, Nicholas Francis, 26, of Thetford Road, Great Barr in Birmingham, Renardo Farrell, 20, of The Terrace, Finchfield in Wolverhampton and Wayne Collins, 25, from Ouseley Close in Luton, Bedfordshire, were all convicted of riot, reckless arson and possession of firearms with intent to endanger life. Arson attack A teenager, 17, who cannot be named, was convicted of riot and firearms offences but cleared of arson. They will be sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday. Joyah Campbell, 19, of Hanover Court, Aston, in Birmingham and another 17-year-old were cleared of the same charges. The court heard during the trial that the force helicopter had been shot at by Laidley, of Chadsmoor Terrace, Nechells, in the early hours of 10 August. Police footage showed a man appear to drop to one knee by a car in Clifton Close, Aston, and point a gun at the helicopter, prosecutor Andrew Lockhart QC said. It was targeted after 12 shots were fired at police called to an arson attack on the Bartons Arms pub. Small fires were started at the Grade II-listed pub but put out without anyone being hurt. 'Blocking carriageway' Furniture was taken outside and from a nearby nightclub and used to blockade the A34, a main route in and out of the city, in what police said was a deliberate attempt to lure officers to the scene and attack them. As many as four guns were present during the incident, Mr Lockhart added. The shots went above and below officers but West Midlands Police said it could have easily become a murder investigation. Senior investigating officer Det Insp Andy Bannister said: \"It was pre-orchestrated with a view to creating an incident which we would say was setting fire to the Bartons Arms pub with complete disregard to the residents upstairs before blocking the carriageway to draw police officers there and attack them. \"It's completely distinct from any other experience that I've had where police officers arrive and individuals ditch their weapons or run away.\"",

It added wind farm developers could use the data to help with planning applications. The energy firm's radar station data provides a second point of reference for air traffic controllers to check that airspace is free from potential turbine interference. The radar station was built by SPR in 2006 to meet concerns raised by Glasgow Airport and National Air Traffic Services (Nats) when the energy firm was seeking planning permission to build Whitelee wind farm near Eaglesham. Whitelee fully opened in 2009 and is now the largest onshore wind farm in Europe. SPR claimed the agreements, which cover a total of five wind farms in central Scotland, could help to \"unblock\" up to 110MW of renewable energy that is \"currently restricted to potential radar concerns\". SPR added it was talking \"with many more developers\" seeking to build wind farm projects and it hoped to reach further agreements in the near future. 'Stumbling block' SPR UK managing director Simon Christian said: \"Radar issues have long been a major stumbling block for wind farm developers. \"During the planning process for Whitelee, the project was held up for a number of years until the radar solution was found. \"By offering radar solutions to other developers we will help to unblock a significant amount of renewable energy, benefiting the wider industry and helping further towards achieving carbon reduction targets.\" SPR is part of a cross-industry aviation group set up in 2009 to look at potential solutions to radar issues in Scotland. The steering group consists of wind farm developers, the operators of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Prestwick airports and Nats. SPR said as much as 4GW of renewable energy potential could be hampered by radar concerns.",

            "input": "By Laurence CawleyBBC News The Tour de France is two races in one. The first will see 198 riders set off on Saturday from Leeds on a 21-stage, 2,271mile (3,656km) pedal slog to Paris. This first stage - the Grand Départ - finishes in Harrogate and is followed by a second stage between York and Sheffield and a third between Cambridge and London. After that, the Tour de France hits French soil. Away from the riders though, another battle is taking place - the race for exposure. Councils and tourism bodies hosting (however fleetingly) the wheels of the Tour de France riders are lining up to show off their wares. Yes, for those who live along or near the route, the Tour de France will mean road closures and delays. But for those seeking to put \"Le Tour\" into their tourism ambitions, those all-too-scant hours of association with the greatest cycle race on earth is a unique opportunity. And they want to tell the world about their \"picturesque villages\", \"vibrant cities\" and \"stunning countryside\". In its introduction to the Grand Depart 2014, Visit Yorkshire tells of the county's \"rolling hills\", \"glorious countryside\" and \"the spectacular beauty\" of its coastline. It also tells of its tea-making talents, breweries and pubs. Gary Verity, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire said the county had been seeking to \"invigorate and galvanise the Yorkshire tourism industry\" since 2009. With the \"world's largest annual sporting event\" on \"our doorstep\", he said, \"the eyes of the entire world will be on Yorkshire\". Those eyes will have plenty to fix upon. In Leeds, bronze statues have been clothed in yellow jerseys, the bunting is out in force and there is a giant inflatable bicycle in front of the Old Post Office building. The landmarks along the route do their best to capture a grand, humorous and cultured Yorkshire some of which might be recognised as television locations. These include Harewood House, where riders will head for the official start after leaving Leeds city centre. It's a grand 18th Century country house whose grounds, designed by landscape architect Capability Brown, are now more widely known as the location for ITV's long-running soap Emmerdale. On Sunday, they will ride past Sid's Café in Holmfirth, best known for its pivotal role in Last of the Summer of the Wine. To mark the Tour de France, the cafe has been decorated with the Tour's 'King of the Mountains' polka dots. Polka dots can also be found on some of the sheep belonging to Harrogate farmer (and cycling enthusiast) Keith Chapman, who has painted his flock in the various shirt colours of the Tour. Meanwhile, again in Harrogate, a large yellow jersey made up of French marigold flowers was created on one of the town's grassy mounds. And across the county, hundreds of yellow-painted bicycles have been put up on walls, railings and at the entrance to villages. One of the most unusual is in Silsden, where the village's branch of the Royal British Legion has created a cyclist and his bike stuck half way into a gap in the wall as part of a speed warning to those passing through. The tour will also pass through the Pennine village of Haworth which was home to the Brontës, arguably the world's most famous literary family. In the mid 19th Century the sisters Charlotte, Emily and Anne Brontë, who lived at the top of the village in The Parsonage, wrote some of the most acclaimed novels in the English language. Haworth sits in the middle of the moors. And the best views of the race as it cuts through the countryside will come from the helicopters above - a fact not lost on the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority. The authority has recreated its ram's head logo on the side of Elbolton Hill using the fleece of sheep. In Huddersfield, the country has been brought into the town, with the sudden appearance of a fully working farm outside the train station thanks to the French artistic group Le Phun. After reaching Sheffield on Sunday, the Tour ups sticks and moves down south to the university city of Cambridge. Before they depart, some riders might just notice some of the 2,000 mini yellow, green and polka dot jerseys which have been knitted to form bunting in the city. Knitters have also been busy at work creating woollen bike wheel covers while artists in all media have been turning out Tour-related works to go up in shop windows and business receptions. Liz Bisset, Cambridge City Council's director of customer and community services, says this demonstration of \"creative energy\" will \"help showcase the city to the watching world on a day that is sure to be spectacular and memorable\". The riders will pass via Trumpington, Great Shelford and Stapleford and across the border into Essex. One site which will be invisible to the riders and bystanders will be a huge piece of art on a 10 hectare patch of land at North Weald Airfield. Artist Nicola Burrell, who came up with the design, said: \"I've taken inspiration from the shapes of the bicycles, riders and slip streams, and I think the design represents the dynamism and excitement which is the Tour de France.\" A spokesman for Essex County Council, which commissioned the work, said the site \"has been carefully chosen so it can be seen from the air\". The Tour will mark a Gallic return for the ancient town of Saffron Walden, which is home to the Norman keep Walden Castle. It was built by Geoffrey de Mandeville during the 12th Century to reinforce his power across the region. The boundary wall, railings and gates of the castle have recently been restored - just in time, says Uttlesford District Council's leader Jim Ketteridge, for the Tour de France. The council also plans to open its museum for the whole day because, according to its visitor services manager Gemma Tully, \"it gives us a perfect excuse to dust off our cycling related exhibits and present them to the cycling enthusiasts we hope to have visiting throughout the day.\" After 73 miles (119km) of riding that day, the Tour's competitors will enter Greater London for the last stretch. They will pass the London 2012 Olympic Park in Stratford, the Tower of London, head along the side of the Thames, passing the Houses of Parliament and finishing, with Buckingham Palace as the backdrop, on The Mall in St James's Park. Exactly how the Palace will welcome the riders of the Tour de France is currently unclear. But painted sheep, knitted bunting and yellow bikes sticking out of its heavy masonry are unlikely.

            "input": "A BBC correspondent says another meeting will have to be called to sort out the difficulties but it is unclear how differences will be resolved. European Council chief Herman Van Rompuy said he was confident a deal would be reached early next year. Hours of talks failed to bridge big gaps between richer countries and those which rely most on EU funding. The UK said current EU spending levels must be frozen. The EU's divisions are very clear and have become even more stark at a time of economic crisis, says the BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels. Mr Van Rompuy had reshuffled the allocations in his original proposed budget during the summit, but he kept in place a spending ceiling of 973bn euros (£783bn; $1.2tn). With the eurozone's dominant states, Germany and France, unable to agree on the budget, UK Prime Minister David Cameron had warned against \"unaffordable spending\". The failure to decide on a budget came just days after the finance ministers of the 17 eurozone states failed to agree on conditions for releasing a new tranche of bailout money to Greece, raising questions about the union's decision-making process. 'No threats' Mr Van Rompuy's budget had been unacceptable to a number of other countries, not just Britain, Mr Cameron told reporters. \"Together, we had a very clear message: 'We are not going to be tough on budgets at home just to come here and sign up to big increases in European spending',\" he said. \"We haven't got the deal we wanted but we've stopped what would have been an unacceptable deal,\" he added. \"And in European terms I think that goes down as progress.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was sympathetic towards Mr Cameron's view - but no more than she was to all countries involved in the discussion. \"The discussions, both the bilateral discussions and the common discussion, have shown us that there is sufficient potential for an agreement,\" she added. French President Francois Hollande said the summit had made \"progress\". \"There were no threats, no ultimatums,\" he told reporters. \"Angela Merkel and I both agreed that it would be better to take some time out because we want there to be an agreement.\" Without naming the UK, he also said it was time the system of budget rebates was reconsidered. \"It is a paradox, because some net contributors [EU countries that pay in more than they get back] get some of the money back even though they are in a situation where they are wealthy enough for them not to get this money back,\" he said. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite remarked that the atmosphere at the summit had been \"surprisingly good because the divergence in opinions was so large that there was nothing to argue about\". European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso said the talks had failed owing to \"important differences of opinion - especially in overall size of the budget\". Revisions The Commission, which drafts EU laws, had originally called for a budget of 1.025tn euros. Its position was supported by the European Parliament and many countries which are net beneficiaries, including Poland, Hungary and Spain. While most EU members supported some increase in the budget, several, mostly the big net contributors, argued it was unacceptable at a time of austerity. Germany, the UK, France and Italy are the biggest net contributors to the budget, which amounts to about 1% of the EU's overall GDP. Mr Van Rompuy's revised budget would have softened the blow to the two main areas of spending: development in the EU's poorer regions, and agriculture. Instead, there would have been greater cuts to energy, transport, broadband and the EU's foreign service. His proposal, put to leaders on Thursday evening, would have made no change to the level of administrative costs - something the UK might have found unacceptable. Speaking after the summit, Mr Van Rompuy said: \"My feeling is that we can go further... It has to be balanced and well prepared, not in the mood of improvisation, because we are touching upon jobs, we are touching upon sensitive issues.\" Failure to agree on the budget by the end of next year would mean rolling over the 2013 budget into 2014 on a month-by-month basis, putting some long-term projects at risk. Analysts say that could leave the UK in a worse position, because the 2013 budget is bigger than the preceding years of the 2007-2013 multi-year budget.",

The Thelma & Louise star was the keynote speaker at an international symposium on gender in media, coinciding with this year's London Film Festival,. The actress founded the Geena Davis Institute in 2004 after watching TV with her young daughter and observing there were \"far fewer\" female characters on screen. \"The ratio of male and female characters has been exactly the same since 1946,\" Davis lamented, with male roles outnumbering females by three to one in most children's film and TV shows. \"The more hours of TV a girl watches the fewer options she thinks she has, the more hours a boy watches, the more sexist he becomes,\" she said in her speech. 'Easy fix' \"Women are seriously under-represented in almost every sector of society across the world,\" she continued, but stressed that the entertainment industry was one of the few where that inequality could be redressed almost overnight. \"Make whatever you were going to make, and just put more women in it. Just cast more women.\" Citing research that showed crowd scenes in films were often only 17% female, the 59-year-old actress argued that the solution was often an \"easy fix\" \"Everywhere I go, I bring that up and they say: 'Why are we doing that? Let's fix that right away!'\" \"We can change what our future looks like,\" Davis told the audience. Reflecting on her own career, which included an Oscar for the 1988 film The Accidental Tourist, Davis said she had \"long been aware there are fewer great parts for women\". 'Sweeping changes' \"Thelma & Louise changed the course of my life,\" she said. \"It brought home to me in a very striking way how few opportunities we give women... to be empowered by the female characters they see on screen. \"Ever since that, I've made choices with that in mind, with the women in the audience in mind.\" But she added: \"I can only be this choosy because, so far, I have not run out of money yet. You can't be as fussy as all that unless you can afford to wait for good parts. If you read that I've signed on to play Sean Connery's comatose wife in a movie, you'll know I'm broke!\" She called on the industry to make \"sweeping changes\". \"I want reaching parity in films to seem fun and easy and creative. Give female characters more to do, more to say, greater aspirations... give them more clothes.\" \"I go directly to talk to the creators, the decision makers, and the response has been overwhelming. Lots of TV and movies have come out now that we know we have impacted.\" \"I feel very confident predicting that the needle will move significantly within the next few years, and it will be historic.\"",

One woman accused of theft in Lagos said she was sexually assaulted, and had tear gas sprayed into her vagina. Nigeria's police told the BBC the force had a \"zero tolerance for torture\". \"It may happen and when it does happen it is appropriately dealt with,\" police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu told the BBC Hausa service. \"Every officer in Nigerian police has a duty post - there is no duty post for torture,\" he said. \"If somebody's tortured let him please report to the next higher authority and then action will be taken.\" Entitled Welcome to Hell Fire, the Amnesty report says people are often detained in large dragnet operations and tortured as punishment, to extort money or to extract \"confessions\" as a way to solve cases. Extrajudicial executions The use of torture is particularly extreme in the north-east in the war against Boko Haram Islamist militants, Amnesty says. The UK-based rights group says between 5,000 and 10,000 people have been arrested there since 2009, and executions in overcrowded detention facilities are common. A teenage boy, pictured at the top, was among 50 people arrested by the army in Pokiskum in Yobe state last year on suspicion being a member of the Boko Haram. At the time he was 15 years old and spent three weeks in custody in Damaturu and said he was beaten continuously with gun butts, batons and machetes. Torture chamber testimony: Chinwe in Anambra state Arrested in 2013 along with other hotel staff after two guns and a human skull were found. They were beaten, detained in a van for hours and then taken to an anti-robbery squad centre in Awkuzu. \"I was thrown inside a cell. I noticed a written sign on the wall 'Welcome to hell fire'… I was taken to the interrogation room. \"There was a police officer at one end with two suspects who were chained together. \"I saw ropes streaming down from the ceiling tops, bags of sand elevated on the perimeter wall fence of the hall and all types of rod and metal in different shapes and sizes. \"I heard shouts and screams from torture victims… I saw buckets of water on standby in case anybody faints or opts to die before appending [their] signature to already written statements.\" The officer questioned him, tied his hands and legs, passed a rod between them and elevated him from a perimeter wall. They poured water on him whenever he passed out. He was charged with murder, has since been freed on bail and is awaiting trial. The boy told Amnesty that melted plastic was poured on his back and he was asked to walk and roll over broken bottles in a hole, and cold water was poured on him and others. A former soldier who served at Damaturu confirmed that torture was routinely used at the camp. \"An electrified baton is used on a person to make them talk,\" he told Amnesty. \"They tie people with their hands stretched behind their arms… people kept like that for six or seven hours lose their hands, people kept like that much longer can even die,\" he said. Amnesty says the report was compiled using 500 interviews during 20 separate visits to Nigeria since 2007. \"Across the country, the scope and severity of torture inflicted on Nigeria's women, men and children by the authorities supposed to protect them is shocking to even the most hardened human rights observer,\" Amnesty's Netsanet Belay said in a statement. The 24-year-old woman sexually assaulted with tear gas says the abuse has left her with a permanent injury. \"A policewoman took me to a small room, told me to remove everything I was wearing. She spread my legs wide and fired tear gas into my vagina… I was asked to confess that I was an armed robber… I was bleeding… up till now I still feel pain in my womb,\" she said. She has been charged with theft and remains in custody awaiting trial 10 months after her arrest. Even though torture is prohibited under the constitution, Amnesty notes that Nigeria's politicians have yet to pass a bill to criminalise it. It says security forces enjoy a climate of impunity and the criminal justice system is riddled with corruption.",

            "input": "By Giancarlo RinaldiSouth Scotland reporter, BBC Scotland news website For the first time some of their primary teachers will have been fully trained in the region. It is thanks to a new course being offered at the University of Glasgow's Crichton Campus which they believe is \"blazing a trail\" in education. The first intake of students - who embarked on their journey four years ago - graduated this week. For a wide range of reasons, they believe the opportunity to undertake their studies in Dumfries was a precious one. Rebecca Duffell went to school in Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders and her family still lives near Hawick. She was attracted by the smaller scale of operations in the region neighbouring her own. \"All the interviews that I had been to before I came to the interview in Dumfries were in bigger inner city campuses,\" she said. \"The difference when I turned up here was how friendly everyone was on the campus.\" She was also impressed by the fact that the Master of Arts format would allow her to continue her studies in English Literature. \"It just seemed to have something quite different to the other primary interviews that I had,\" she added. Next year the pupils at Lincluden Primary will get to find out what sort of skills she has acquired. For Claire Devlin, who will be at St Ninians in Dumfries from August, there were sound financial reasons for staying in her home town. \"I chose to study in Dumfries because I am from Dumfries so it meant I didn't have to move away and I didn't have to get a student loan,\" she said. \"It meant I could still live at home and I didn't have to pay my digs or rent or anything like that. \"And, because it is such a small campus, it means that it is really personal teaching.\" Claire Logan, also from Dumfries, is heading to Australia to teach after graduating, a chance she thought she might never have. \"I have got children, I couldn't have done it without this course being here,\" she explained. \"It has been great, it has changed my life. \"We have been really, really lucky because we have had really good lecturers and it has been interesting all the time.\" Those words are music to the ears of campus director and head of the school of interdisciplinary studies Prof David Clark. \"This is a terrific day for the campus and a wonderful day for the 11 students that have graduated,\" he said. \"This is a very unusual degree, probably the first of its kind in Scotland. \"Not only are they going out as qualified primary school teachers to work in the region and further afield but they also have an MA with a very broad-based curriculum that they have followed over four years. \"So they are exceptionally well-educated and well-trained in the work that they have been doing here.\" Eight of the 11 graduates are staying in the region with two heading to nearby South Lanarkshire and one to Australia. Prof Clark said that was a \"wonderful tribute\" to people at the university, Dumfries and Galloway Council and primary head teachers who had had the vision some years ago that a course of this type would be viable in Dumfries. He added that he believed the teachers it was producing were exactly the kind being sought in the recent Donaldson report on education - \"well rounded\" individuals capable of \"critical thinking\". He also believes that, despite the difficulties of some young teachers in getting employment, the graduates have something extra to offer. \"They are not just well-trained teachers but they are highly educated across a broad range of subjects that makes them really attractive candidates in the job market,\" he said. The word about the course has clearly got out, as this year there were 350 applications for the course - nearly 10 for every available place. That, in turn, strengthens the case for extra funding for the campus. Which all means that in years to come there should be an ever increasing number of locally trained teachers in the schools of Dumfries and Galloway.",

Residents living on the Wildmill estate said the rest of the county was using their estate as a \"landfill\" site. But the council said most residents had embraced efforts to limit waste and increase recycling. Official statistics show the total number of reported fly-tipping offences in Wales fell to 35,076 last year, the lowest recorded figure since 2014-15. But analysis of the figures showed Conwy, Flintshire, Carmarthenshire, Merthyr Tydfil and Blaenau Gwent all recorded record levels of dumping last year. Incidents involving fly-tipping of black bags - rubbish which should go in the household waste bin - also increased in areas where bin collections have been changed. Merthyr Tydfil council said it was having issues with people dumping black bags next to bins in cemeteries and parks. Conwy While recycling rates have improved since controversial bin changes were brought in, the number of black bags being dumped illegally has almost quadrupled. In 2015-16, before a trial of monthly bin collections was brought in, 129 black bin bags were fly-tipped, the following year this had increased to 282. And by the end of March 2019, when the pilot was rolled out across the whole county, the figure stood at 416. The county has been judged one of the cleanest places to live in Wales, and recorded its highest street cleanliness rating in 10 years, last year. But one resident said, since the changes, people had been dumping bags in public litter bins and on industrial estates. Others said charges at tips had let to an increase in fly-tipping. Another resident said she had her locks broken on her bins twice by fly-tippers and had to pay a private contractor to take the waste away. Cabinet member Greg Robbins said there was no excuse for fly-tipping as most households were managing fine with the monthly collections. Bridgend In Bridgend, residents said there has been an increase in fly-tipping since changes to bin rules. The system, introduced in 2017, limited homes with fewer than five occupants to throwing out just two bags of non-recyclable rubbish every fortnight. But figures show there were 1,937 reports of fly-tipping last year - the highest level in more than a decade. The number of black bags filled with household waste being fly-tipped has increased by almost 200% - from 297 the year before the changes were introduced, to 873 last year. On the Wildmill estate, where about 1,000 people live, residents said people were coming from across the county to dump their bags. The estate has communal bins for recycling, and boxes with blue crosses on for bags to be collected - but residents said people were coming from miles away to dump their bags onto the piles, leaving litter strewn everywhere. Rachel Nicholls said she was sick of living in a \"rat-infested hole\" and living in a \"landfill\" site for the rest of Bridgend. \"Everybody else is treated like a person, but here in Wildmill we are treated like second-class citizens,\" she said. \"We have pride in where we live, everyone knows they are fly-tipping but they don't care.\" But the council said its investigations showed the vast majority of fly-tipping in Wildmill originated from residents. \"Bridgend County Borough was recently confirmed as having the second-highest recycling rate in the UK, and the success of this ultimately lies with how the vast majority of local residents have embraced efforts to limit waste and increase recycling,\" a spokesman said. Merthyr Tydfil Merthyr Tydfil council replaced every 240-litre bin with slim-lined 140-litre models, after being judged one of the worst areas for recycling in Wales. Some residents complained they were too small to fit all their rubbish in. Looking at figures, last year the number of illegally-dumped black bin bags hit an all time high, with 1,010 incidents recorded. This has increased year-on-year since the changes were introduced in 2015. The number of incidents of household items, such as fridges, being dumped also reached record levels last year. Gelligaer and Merthyr Common has been a hotspot for people to dump their waste for years. The ranger there said residents had noticed a spike in fly-tipping after changes to the tip - but this had since improved. He said they were hoping to get ditches dug at the side of roads to stop people being able to dump on the common. Merthyr Tydfil council confirmed there had been a spike in black bags being collected by fly-tipping teams, and it was having issues with bags being dumped in cemeteries and parks. Blaenau Gwent In 2015 there were protests when Blaenau Gwent moved to a new bin collection system. It limited black bin collections to once every three weeks and introduced \"Troliblocs\", a stack of three recycling boxes on a wheeled trolley. And in June 2018 it introduced a \"no side waste\" policy, with a black bag sorting system introduced at its household waste recycling centre. According to figures, the number of black bags being fly-tipped went from zero in 2015-16 to 107 in 2016-17, hitting an all time high of 170 last year. Overall fly-tipping reports have increased every year since 2015-16 and are now at an all time high.",

Mr Pacquiao's original remark, made during a TV interview, drew ire from gay Filipino celebrities and a rights group and sparked heated discussion. Initially he appeared unrepentant, writing in a post in Instagram that he was \"just telling the truth of what the Bible says\". 'Common sense' The former world champion, who positions himself as a conservative Christian politician, is running for a senate seat in May elections. Mr Pacquiao, who is a member of the Philippines house of representatives, was speaking to local station TV5 earlier this week for its election coverage. In a clip posted online (in Tagalog), he tells the interviewer: \"It's common sense. Will you see any animals where male is to male and female is to female? \"The animals are better. They know how to distinguish male from female. If we approve [of] male on male, female on female, then man is worse than animals.\" Filipino comedian Vice Ganda and singer Aiza Seguerra, who are openly gay, have criticised Mr Pacquiao for his comments, calling him a \"hypocrite\" and a \"false prophet\". Local gay rights organisation and political group Ladlad condemned his remarks and issued a call to voters to boycott Mr Pacquiao. It said in a statement, reported in local media, that his view \"betrays a shallow understanding of sexual orientation and gender identity\" and that failure to understand gay rights issues would leave him in the dark ages \"when the cavemen ruled and the numbskulls roamed the Earth\". On Tuesday, Mr Pacquiao, who has won world titles in eight different weight divisions, had posted a picture of himself with his wife on Instagram in an apparent response to the controversy. He said: \"I rather obey the Lord's command than obeying the desires of the flesh. I'm not condemning anyone, but I'm just telling the truth of what the Bible says.\" The furore has split the online world, where many Christian followers have shown support for Mr Pacquiao, while others have condemned him for his views. Manny Pacquiao remains hugely popular in the Philippines, and has spoken frequently about his renewed Christian faith. He represents his wife's home province of Sarangani in the lower house. Many Filipinos hold conservative views on gay rights because much of the population is Catholic, but the country has several prominent gay personalities and the capital, Manila, also has a vibrant gay scene.",

Profits also slumped for its generation and supply business, following a drop in demand. Domestic electricity demand fell year-on-year by 6.8%, while gas demand was down by 6.6%. Scottish Power, which is owned by Iberdrola of Spain, attributed the falls to milder weather in 2017. 'Less output' Earnings for the division before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were down year-on-year by more than 75%, at £46.5m. The company's retail business saw earnings down by £92.9m, while its generation business posted a profits fall of £47.7m as a result of \"less output and lower margins on ancillary services\". Earnings were also down slightly for its energy networks division, which the group said was in line with expectations. However, there was better news for its renewables arm, which saw EBITDA rise by 34.7% year-on-year, to £211.6m. Scottish Power said total wind power production had increased by 34% so far this year, with a 37% uplift in onshore wind alone during the third quarter, compared with a year ago. Chief corporate officer Keith Anderson said: \"In retail, we have more customers on fairer deals than any other 'big six' suppliers and we are the only bigger company to have increased its market share since 2011. \"We believe that putting our existing customers before new customers is the best way to compete in this marketplace. That is why we work hard to reward our customers' loyalty by getting them onto better deals. \"Our view remains that the proposed price cap will not to help to engage those customers who could still find a better deal. \"It will be bad for consumers, energy companies big and small, as well as investor confidence.\"",

Smokers use it to lace joints, believing the anti-retroviral Stocrin increases the hallucinogenic effects of marijuana - though there is no scientific proof of this. The threat to HIV patients in this poor community of KwaZulu-Natal province is very real. \"On the one hand, we are battling to stay alive,\" says 49-year-old Phumzile Sibiya, who has been taking ARV drugs for six months. \"Now we have to worry about thugs who will want to rob us for a chance to live because that's what they are stealing from us when they take our pills.\" Ms Sibiya and other HIV patients now visit the clinic in a group to ensure their safety. \"I just don't feel safe at all when I come to collect my pills. You never know where they could be waiting for you. This is very painful,\" she says as she shuffles along a long queue at Ithembalabantu Clinic, south of Durban. 'Cravings' The clinic is the biggest distributor of Aids drugs in this part of KwaZulu-Natal, the province with the highest number of HIV infections in the country. About six million South Africans are infected with HIV and an estimated 700,000 of those are on life-prolonging ARV treatment. South Africa's police chief Bheki Cele has described whoonga as \"a big national concern\" and said the force's elite Hawks unit was investigating its contribution to crime. Dr Bright Mhlongo, who heads Ithembalabantu clinic, agrees that the growing popularity of whoonga is worrying. \"The use of Stocrin in whoonga will limit our already limited resources in terms of ARV treatment in Africa,\" he told the BBC. \"This pill is the backbone of our ARV treatment - it is what we use for most of our patients. \"If we lose it as a base drug we might be forced to use other drugs which are a lot more expensive and not as easily available.\" Whoonga is cheap compared to other drugs on the streets - a single tablet costs 20 rand ($3; £1.70). Recovering addict Vukani Mahlase, who is also an HIV patient, says users often need multiple hits in a day. \"When the cravings come and you don't have money you are prepared to do anything,\" he says. \"My friends and I would use guns and knives, anything at our disposal, all for a bit of money to buy the next hit.\" He has just left prison after spending a year inside for robbing someone for drugs money and says he is determined to quit the habit. \"The doctors have warned me that if I continue smoking whoonga it could affect how well my body responds to my medication,\" he says. Doctors say smoking whoonga poses severe health risks including internal bleeding, stomach ulcers and in some instances death. 'Friend died' A whoonga smoker in his twenties, who did not want to give his name, says its high is a bitter-sweet experience. \"It is very addictive and you have to take it just to feel normal. When I'm craving a hit my joints ache and I have bad stomach cramps, it feels like your insides are on fire. I am forced to take it just so the pain can stop,\" he says of his three-year habit. Many young men at Whoonga Free, a community project for recovering drug users in KwaDabeka township outside Durban, often blame peer pressure for their addiction. \"There are no jobs here and you end up getting involved in wrong things. Whoonga was the in-thing at the time so that's why I started smoking it, I wanted to fit in,\" says 21-year-old Thabane Chamane. Siphesihle Pakisi, 19, agrees. \"I was struggling to deal with my parents' divorce at the time and my friends told me about this drug that made you forget all your problems. They said it made you stress-free and it seemed to work but only for a short while,\" he says. He and his friends would spend up to 200 rand a day on whoonga but decided to quit when one of his friends died from an overdose. \"A friend of mine died right before my eyes last year. He threw up his intestines - it was really scary I didn't want that to happen to me,\" he says, staring into the distance. Up until 2008, the government's ARV programme was limited because it felt the drugs were too expensive. President Jacob Zuma's two-year-old administration has promised to roll them out more extensively, but it will have to make sure the drugs end up in the right hands. Thokozani Sokhulu, who set up Whoonga Free in 2008, says he has dealt with hundreds of victims of the drug in that time. \"It is not enough to arrest the people who sell the drugs you need to offer its users an alternative way of living,\" he says. \"Our young people are crying out for help.\"",

Mustafa, who was found guilty of murder on Tuesday, killed Ms Khan less than two years after serving a hospital order for attacking a former partner. He was sentenced at Derby Crown Court to serve a minimum of 33 years. The court heard Mustafa began beating Ms Khan straight after she moved from Bradford into his Normanton home in April 2017. During the trial jurors were told 36 recent injuries across her body were discovered, including burns from an iron. Mrs Justice Carr, sentencing, described Mustafa as \"sadistic and deceitful\" and a \"dangerous\" man. 'Narcissistic grooming' Det Ch Insp Emlyn Richards, from Derbyshire Police, said Mustafa \"never accepted any responsibility or provided an account of what happened to Sobhia\", and had booked a flight to Pakistan \"to avoid taking responsibility for his actions\". \"[He] wanted to exert control and power over women,\" he said. \"His narcissistic and sadistic grooming of Sohbia led her to Derby and within weeks of arriving, she had been tortured over several days and brutally murdered.\" Lynsey O'Donnell, a senior crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in the East Midlands, said proving Mustafa's guilt was \"not straightforward\", but evidence of his behaviour before and after Ms Khan's killing showed he \"was in full control of his actions\" and that it was \"demonstrating a pattern of behaviour\".",

            "input": "Nick TriggleHealth correspondent@nicktriggleon Twitter The challenge for the hard-pressed control centre staff is working out which cases are genuinely life threatening - and which are not - so they can prioritise where to send crews. How do they do that? They have a complex set of questions that have to help them determine how to categorise patients. There are about 7,500 different codes and a decision has to be made quickly. Unsurprisingly it leads to mistakes being made. About a quarter of crews dispatched to life-threatening calls in England, which have a target of eight minutes to be reached, are called back before they reach the scene. A similar situation arises in Northern Ireland, Scotland and, until last year, Wales. But faced with growing pressures in the system - in Northern Ireland nearly one in two critical calls are not reached in eight minutes and in England it is over a third - ambulance bosses have started to re-think their approach. The answer they seem to be reaching is to scrap the eight-minute target for all but the most immediately life-threatening cases. Wales has already done this. Last October it reduced the number of calls it aims to answer in eight minutes to about 5% of the total, whereas previously it aimed to get to about a third in that timescale. Scotland introduced a similar system last week and England has started piloting its own version in three areas this year. Wales, like the rest of the UK, was struggling to respond to life-threatening calls within the eight- So what gets chucked out of the eight-minute group? All sorts. Strokes, some road traffic accidents, people having fits and those experiencing chest pains. This sounds radical - and risky. But ambulance bosses suggest it is not. Take stroke, for example. All the evidence suggests that what matters most is that a patient gets to a properly equipped stroke unit within an hour for tests and treatment. Whether an ambulance crew reaches them in eight, 10 or 12 minutes is of little consequence. And by scrapping the eight-minute target for all but the most obviously life-threatening, the bosses argue ambulance services get the breathing space they need to properly consider whether an immediate dispatch is necessary, thereby cutting back on the unnecessary journeys. And here's the clever bit: by doing that response times across the board improve because there are more ambulances available. Or that's the theory anyway. The problem is we just don't really know. There has been little published on what impact this has had in the places where it is happening. A major report on the changes is due to be published next spring. That will be telling. If ambulance bosses have got this right it could prove to be the solution to the incredible pressures on the service that are being documented by the BBC today. But get it wrong and lives will be put at risk. The stakes are high. Read more from Nick Follow Nick on Twitter",

            "input": "By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website Starting early or late could alter the risk of nearly 48 separate conditions, including the age of menopause. The analysis of half a million people, published in Scientific Reports, showed early puberty increased the odds of type 2 diabetes by 50%. The researchers said it was \"astonishing\" that puberty was having an impact on health in mid-life. The team at the MRC Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge used data from a huge study of the health of British people - the UK Biobank. The project recorded the age of girls' first period, but a measure of the start of puberty is harder to define in men, so they were asked if they were earlier or later compared to the rest of their peer group. In girls an early puberty was defined as starting between eight and 11, while a late puberty started between 15 and 19. A normal puberty was between nine and 14 in boys. The study showed that early and late puberty was linked to a wide range of health conditions, such as: Hormones have been implicated in some of the conditions, such as cancer, although the researchers admit that they have \"very little idea\" what might contribute to diseases such as asthma. Dr Felix Day told the BBC News website: \"From a biological point of view, it's actually quite fascinating that something that happens when you're a teenager can have an effect on diseases that you wouldn't encounter until middle age. I find that quite astonishing.\" The age of puberty is changing around the world. In the UK it is currently starting about one month earlier every decade. In China it is more than four months earlier every decade. Dr Day said this was \"something people involved in public health should be aware of\". \"The move towards earlier puberty is an added risk factor in terms of development of particularly metabolic diseases.\" However, as the study showed an increased risk for both early and late puberty, there could be a decrease in the incidence of some conditions. He added that because someone had an early or late puberty did not mean they would develop these conditions - it just altered the odds. Dr John Perry, from the MRC Epidemiology Unit, added: \"We are continuing to work to understand how puberty timing impacts later health and how this information may be used alongside efforts to support healthy lifestyle changes and prevent disease. \"It is important to note that the increase in disease risk attributable to puberty timing is still relatively modest and represents one of many factors that contribute to the overall risk of developing disease.\"",

            "input": "The seat became vacant after Sinn Féin's Barry McElduff resigned, amid outcry over a video of himself with a loaf of Kingsmill bread on his head. It was posted on Twitter on the 42nd anniversary of the Kingsmills murders, in which 10 Protestant workmen were shot dead by the IRA. Five candidates are standing in Thursday's election, in what will be the fourth by-election in Northern Ireland this century. West Tyrone was first contested as a constituency in the General Election of 1997. Then, an Ulster Unionist MP, William Thompson, was returned. But four years later, the tide turned and Sinn Féin's Pat Doherty took just shy of 41% of the vote. When he retired last year, his party colleague, Barry McElduff, held the seat for the party, with almost 51% of the poll. Not quite a year on from that sweeping victory and just five months after the tweet that brought Barry McElduff down, a by-election is taking place. Twenty-six year old solicitor Órfhlaith Begley is stepping into the fray, in the belief Sinn Féin party loyalty will help her retain the seat. 'Better infrastructure' The daughter of a long-serving local councillor, she has been a party activist, canvassing on her father's behalf for many years. She is the only woman on the ballot paper. \"I know the ground in West Tyrone, it's no new territory to me,\" she said. \"Brexit is the main issue of course, but there are other issues. People want the economy to thrive, people want jobs coming to the area, people want better infrastructure.\" Infrastructure has divided the constituency in recent years, with the proposed A5 upgrade delayed by legal challenges and funding issues. If Órfhlaith Begley wins, she will be the constituency's first female MP, and the fourth occupant of the position in the seat's 21-year history. Sinn Féin had a majority of more than 10,000 votes over its nearest rival last year. That rival is the oldest of the five candidates, Tom Buchanan of the DUP. A serving MLA and former councillor, he worked in construction before going into politics. While his party has a different take on Brexit, he has heard the same concerns on the doorsteps. \"The main issue in the constituency is infrastructure,\" he said. High rate of entrepreneurship \"We have roads infrastructure, we have broadband issues, then we have health issues, we have education issues, we have job creation, and all of those issues are issues facing a rural constituency.\" About two-thirds of West Tyrone is rural and the constituency has the highest rate of entrepreneurship in Northern Ireland. But there are major employers there as well, like IT company Allstate NI, with an office in Strabane, and there is also Asda in Omagh. About 40% of the businesses in the area are agriculture based. Broadband presents a huge challenge, with a little more than 70% having access to a superfast service, compared with the Northern Ireland average of more than 87%. That access varies widely across the constituency. Thursday will be the fifth time in two years that the polling booths have been dusted off. But there appears to be little sense of voter fatigue among the candidates. \"There's anger at why [this by-election] was called, there's frustration because we've had so many elections recently,\" said Ulster Unionist candidate Chris Smyth, a councillor on Fermanagh and Omagh District Council. \"But I think there's a real appetite for change, and if I can harness that and be the face of that change, then I think we'll be in a strong position.\" Change is in the offing for young people in the Omagh area, with the advent of the Strule Shared Education Campus, on the former Lisnaelly Army barracks site. But only one school has moved in to it, Arvalee Special School, and work has yet to begin on the construction of the other five schools due to move there. 'Leaders of change' The scheme has cost £30m, so far, and the date for completion had already been pushed back to September 2021, before one of the bidders pulled out of the tender process earlier this year. Like the constituency itself, four of the candidates are in their twenties. \"I think that's positive you know,\" Stephen Donnelly said. The 23-year-old is standing on behalf of the Alliance Party. \"I think the new generations should be coming forward and they should be offering their ideas. \"Ultimately, it is us that are going to be inheriting the world that's coming forward and it's right that we should be the leaders of that change.\" The second oldest person on the ballot paper is a veteran of five elections, at the tender age of 29. Daniel McCrossan of the SDLP split the party when he was first selected in 2016. He is now a sitting MLA and, for him, a key issue is the A5 road proposal that has divided the constituency both physically and emotionally. \"We want to see the A5. It's no secret that I'm very strongly in favour of it and have worked tirelessly to see it,\" he said. \"But again, in the absence of the assembly, all those things are up in the air. The question for the electorate in this election is very simple, do you want representation or do you not?\" Voting takes place between 07: 00 BST and 22:00 BST on Thursday, 3 May.

Ms Dodds said Oxford and Oxford Brookes universities, both in her constituency, had worked \"really hard to make sure [students'] return is as safe as possible\".

It is the latest planning application after the multi-million pound project was beset with problems and delays. The Department for Communities confirmed that over £9m had been spent on the project to date.

Ulster GAA said the planning application came after an \"unprecedented\" 32-week consultation. Planning permission for the sports stadium was overturned in 2014 after objections by local residents. The GAA unveiled fresh plans for the stadium last October. It said height, scale and capacity were all reduced from the previous design and that it was aiming to work within the original budget of £76m. In confirming the latest planning application, Ulster GAA said it had received 95% approval from about 3,000 people who responded to the stadium consultation.

And on Monday, seven years after the first one went on sale, Raspberry Pi 4 is launched. The latest version of the barebones computer is a significant upgrade - three times faster than the Raspberry Pi 3, which came out in 2016. Retailers report a lot of interest, with one telling me it sold out of all versions of the Pi within a few hours. \"It feels like a coming of age for us,\" says Raspberry Pi's founder Eben Upton. \"It's 40 times as powerful as the original Pi and it's the first time that we're shipping a device that, for most users, will be subjectively indistinguishable from a traditional desktop computer.\" What has also changed is that as well as the basic £34 model you can pay up to £54 for a device with more RAM - perhaps designed to be attractive to commercial users rather than schools. You can also pay more for kits with all you need to turn it into a desktop computer - something that seemed pretty daunting to some who bought early versions of the Pi for their children. I was supplied with a kit a few days ago, and over the weekend managed - without any help from a young person - to get it up and running and streaming the BBC iPlayer. That more nuanced pricing policy tells you how this project has changed over the years as it has tried to steer a course, not always successfully, between its original educational mission and its unexpected triumph as a commercial business. Early days I first came across the Raspberry Pi when Mr Upton and the Cambridge-based games entrepreneur David Braben came to my office in May 2011. They brought with them a prototype about the size of a USB stick. They explained that they hoped it would cost around £15 and that schools would give it to children, with the aim of transforming the way they understood computing. I thought it was an interesting if slightly sketchy idea and decided to shoot a video of the device on my phone and post it on YouTube. Within days, tens of thousands of people had viewed the video, showing that this was a project which might well capture the imagination of the public. And when the first Pi came out in 2012, it was indeed a huge hit, sparking interest from around the world. However, much of the enthusiasm came not from schools or teenagers, but from 40-something men with memories of learning to code with the BBC Micro or the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. While some schools did start Raspberry Pi clubs, many struggled to integrate the device into a curriculum which was quite rigid when it came to how computing was taught. As sales boomed and companies discovered that the Raspberry Pi was a useful cheap device to employ in any number of manufacturing processes, it looked as though the project's original purpose might fade away. But these days it seems to be back on track. The project was split into two, a commercial division and an educational foundation funded by the profits from sales of the Pi. In 2015 the Raspberry Pi foundation merged with Code Club and it now employs more than 100 people, compared with the 50 working on the commercial side. Mr Upton, who runs the commercial division, is keen to stress that education is still at the heart of the project. \"We hope to see the Raspberry Pi 4 in school computer labs, after-school clubs and children's bedrooms across the UK, and indeed the world.\" With more competition and a long gap between models, Raspberry Pi sales have levelled off in the last couple of years. The hope now is that this new grown-up little computer, designed and built in the UK, will power the Pi and its mission forward again.",

More than £50,000 has been donated since the BT Sport presenter shared the appeal with his 900,000 followers. On Sunday, Humphrey met Mr Coniam and his wife Naomi's son Ernie at a fun day to celebrate his year of challenges. A rainbow baby is a term given for a healthy baby born to parents who have experienced the loss of a child. It stems from the idea that a rainbow, symbolising hope and comfort, follows the storm of grief caused by a baby dying. Mr Coniam set himself nine challenges after his daughter Norah died nine hours after being born in May 2018. The father said he \"can't thank Jake enough\" for sharing his fundraising page to his 900,000 followers on Twitter. \"It's become bigger than I ever imagined,\" he said. Humphrey said the experience was the \"greatest\" moment he has had online. \"Social media can be a thoroughly negative, demoralising place, but the Nine 4 Norah story restored my faith in people on the platform,\" he said. Speaking at the fun day in Letchworth, Humphrey said he did not take any credit for the money raised. \"I was just the facilitator who had the opportunity with a large platform to send the message out there for this man's amazing work,\" he said. \"This is about Ross. Lots of people will lose a child but they won't go and do was Ross has done.\" Mr Coniam had to postpone one of nine challenges, the Great North Run on Tyneside, due to an injury, but hopes to complete it next year instead. Among the challenges he has completed are the London Marathon and a 135-mile walk from Gloucestershire to his daughter's grave. Mr Coniam has been raising money for the stillbirth and neo-natal death charities Sands and 4Louis, Iolanthe Midwifery, and Keech Hospice in Luton.",

The announcement was made on the first day of a three-day meeting with investors in Hong Kong on Tuesday. The Asia-focused bank has been facing tough market conditions and has issued three profit warnings this year. \"We recognise our recent performance has been disappointing and are determined to get back on to a trajectory of sustainable, profitable growth, delivering returns above our cost of capital,\" said finance director Andy Halford in a presentation to investors. Last month, the bank reported a 16% fall in third quarter operating profit from a year ago, due to restructuring of its business and an increase in bad loans, particularly in Asia. The bank had seen 10 years of record earnings that ended in 2012. Its London-listed shares are down over 30% so far this year. In August, the lender also agreed to pay $300m in fines to New York regulators for failing to improve its money laundering controls that were first identified in 2012.",

            "input": "Anthony Hensley, 37, worked for a company that provided swans to keep geese away from property. On Saturday morning, the married father of two set out in a kayak across a pond at a residential complex in Des Plaines, just outside Chicago, where he was tending the birds. One of the swans charged his boat, capsizing it, says Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, whose deputies investigated the death. Mr Hensley tried to swim to shore but eyewitnesses told the sheriff's investigators the swan appeared to have actively blocked him. \"I find myself still scratching my head,\" says Sheriff Dart. \"This truly is one of the ones that keeps you from saying 'I've seen everything now.'\" According to ornithologists, the swan's aggressive reaction is typical for the species, the mute swan, when defending a nest. \"It's presumably a male swan and it's presumably paired, and it's set up home for the spring,\" says Chris Perrins, Her Majesty's Swan Warden and a retired Oxford ornithologist. \"It's going to defend that territory.\" The males are fierce in defence of their nests, especially during the spring nesting season - April to June. The birds are one of the largest waterfowl in North America and Europe, weighing up to 13kg (28lbs) and with a wing span of up to 2.4m (7.9ft). They are among the heaviest flying birds in the UK. In April 2010, a swan on the River Cam in England made the news after repeatedly attacking rowers. It was nicknamed Mr Asbo, named after the Anti-Social Behaviour Orders issued by UK courts at the time. Two years later, there are still calls for it to be removed from the river, as the seasonal attacks go on. But such incidents are very rare, says John Huston of the Abbotsbury Swannery in Dorset, where there are 1,000 swans but no recorded attacks on humans in the colony's 600-year history. \"If you approach a swan nest on the river, they might get aggressive and hiss and flap their wings, but the danger is over-rated and it's a myth that they will break your leg or arm with their wings. \"They are not that strong and it's mostly show and bluster.\" Perrins says he has spent many years handling swans and never been injured, just received the odd bruise. \"They do fairly vigorously defend their little patch this time of year. Once the eggs are hatched he'll stay with the family and defend it. \"They have a reputation for being a bit aggressive, but it's only that it's a matter of size, I guess. Presumably a duck wouldn't attack you because you look a bit big.\" However, a large swan can give a thump, he says, and the best advice is to stay away from the nest, which is often a place along the bank or shore where the reeds are flattened and the female is sitting. Mute swans often defend in pairs, says Julia Newth, research officer at the Wildlife and Wetlands Trust. \"Habitats with abundant food and with suitable nesting sites may be highly fought over. \"Those intruding on their territory, including large wildfowl, land mammals and people, may be warded off with an aggressively fast swimming approach, often accompanied with hissing and busking, which is a threat display where the swans neck is curved back and its wings are half raised. \"Mute swans tend to use the power of their wings to attack rather than their beaks.\" John Faaborg, a biologist at the University of Missouri and president of the American Ornithologists' Union, has known people who were hurt by geese attacks. \"And I am sure that swans can do major damage given that they are so big.\" In this case in Chicago, he says, it's understandable that someone in a river with their clothes and shoes on was unable to overpower a swan and swim to shore.

Doubt was later cast on his account after US media reported that police believed he may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack. Mr Smollett's lawyers said they would \"conduct a thorough investigation and mount an aggressive defence\". On Wednesday a police spokesman said felony criminal charges had been approved against the actor. Mr Smollett had been charged for \"disorderly conduct / filing a false police report\", the spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said in a tweet. \"Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.\" Lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, who are representing the actor, said in a statement: \"Like any other citizen, Mr Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.\" They had previously said that Mr Smollett had \"been further victimised by claims... that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth.\" Earlier on Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage which appeared to show the two brothers buying materials, including ski masks, that had allegedly been worn by the actor's attackers. The brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, left the US after the alleged attack and were arrested on their return last week. They were later released and are said to be co-operating with the investigation. One of the brothers is Smollett's personal trainer and both have worked as extras on Empire. What did Smollett say happened? The actor, who is gay, said he had gone out to buy food late at night when two white men hurled racial and homophobic insults at him, punched him, poured a chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck. \"This is Maga country,\" he says they told him, referring to President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan. The actor said he had been \"forever changed\" by the incident. The incident led to an outpouring of support for Smollett from stars including Oscar winner Viola Davis and supermodel Naomi Campbell.",

            "input": "A third of detained children had developed mental illnesses of such severity that they required psychiatric treatment, the Australian Human Rights Commission (HRC) said. It called for all detained children to be released immediately. PM Tony Abbott has called the report a blatant attack on his government. Mr Abbott said the commission \"should be ashamed of itself\" for being so partisan. Under his government the number of children in detention has fallen. Mr Abbott questioned why the HRC did not launch an inquiry when the Labor government was in power and there were almost 2,000 children in detention centres. Successive Australian governments have been criticised over their harsh asylum policies, under which asylum seekers are detained for long periods in offshore camps while their applications are processed. Opinion polls show that such policies are popular with voters concerned about asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat. 'Cruel and illegal' The long-awaited report, entitled The Forgotten Children, was completed late last year and released by the government on Wednesday. It argues that there is no sensible explanation for the prolonged detention of children which is \"in clear violation of international human rights law\". \"The overarching finding of the enquiry is that the prolonged, mandatory detention of asylum-seeker children causes them significant mental and physical illness and developmental delays, in breach of Australia's international obligations,\" the foreword says. The report found that: It calls for the closure of immigration detention facilities on Christmas Island, an end to indefinite detentions and the replacement of the immigration minister by an independent person to act as guardian for unaccompanied children. \"The aims of stopping people smugglers and deaths at sea do not justify the cruel and illegal means adopted,\" Commission President Gillian Triggs wrote. \"Australia is better than this.\" Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said many of the recommendations in the report were unnecessary, while others \"would mean undermining the very policies that mean children don't get on boats in the first place\". Attorney General George Brandis said that the government did not accept the commission's conclusions. Australia currently detains all asylum seekers who arrive by boat, holding them in offshore processing camps. Those found to be refugees will not be permanently resettled in Australia. It also has a backlog of cases - about 30,000 - relating to asylum seekers who arrived before the current policies were put in place. Those people live in detention camps or in the community under bridging visas that do not allow them to work. The opposition Labor party, the Greens and human rights groups have called for significant changes to the immigration detention network following publication of the report.

During Wright’s interrogation  which was recounted at trial in testimony by a local police officer  he claimed that  Hoxha  reached out to him via Paltalk and asked him if he was interested in Islamic State. Wright told the officer that he responded three weeks later after conducting research  telling  Hoxha  that  he  believed that Islamic State’s’ mission was legitimate and necessary. From this point on  Hoxha and Wright were in frequent contact via Paltalk and Skype’s instant messenger service  sharing videos  issues of Islamic State’s official magazine Dabiq  and news articles about the group and its activities. These conversations between Wright and  Hoxha  continued until April 2015  when  Hoxha  left the U.S. to join Islamic State. Among the subjects of most interest were the best options for joining and what would ensure the maximum religious reward. Some early Western travelers believed that they could migrate to Islamic State-held territory (an act that the group refers to as hijrah)  but only participate in the societal aspects of the self-declared Caliphate while avoiding combat and violence. Neither Wright nor  Hoxha  appear to have held that naïve delusion. According to trial exhibits of their conversations  Wright cautioned  Hoxha  that “if you want to travel and live under a dawla [Islamic state] there is no harm in that  but you won’t receive the reward from Allah like those who are assembled in the ranks unless you assemble in the ranks.”",

To gentrify a neighborhood also involves quieting it down. The desire for sonic control in and around the home is prioritized above the social fabric of the city  a practice exemplified by the targeting of arts and music venues that are cited as being partially responsible for neighborhood revival in the first place. In her book Beyond Unwanted Sound  Marie Thompson describes an example from the industrial area of Ouseburn Valley in the United Kingdom. The region had become a hotbed of music and the arts partly because there were few residences to disturb. Eventually  several venues closed after repeated run-ins with the law due to noise complaints. These complaints came not from concerned locals  but from wealthy newcomers buying into new developments built explicitly to capitalize on the area’s vibrant nightlife. The noise that does the most harm doesn’t come from clubs and house parties—the causes of many garden-variety noise complaints and violations. Ironically   Rice  did get something right in  her  crusade: Industrial noise poses the worst problem  although individual workers were not to blame for it  as  Rice  had also concluded. The two largest sources of environmental noise are transportation and industrial activity. The cars for which early noise ordinances helped clear the streets have amplified that noise to a universal  inescapable level. Industrial areas  often designated for land close to the poorest nonwhite areas in a city  are even worse.",

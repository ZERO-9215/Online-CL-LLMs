            "input": "Our 'impartial' broadcasters have become mouthpieces of the elite. When people say they have no politics, it means that their politics aligns with the status quo . None of us are unbiased , none removed from the question of power . We are social creatures who absorb the outlook and opinions of those with whom we associate, and unconciously echo them . Objectivity is impossible . The illusion of neutrality is one of the reasons for the rotten state of journalism, as those who might have been expected to hold power to account drift thoughtlessly into its arms . But until I came across the scandal currently erupting in Canada, I hadn't understood just how quickly standards are falling . In 2013 reporters at CBC, Canada's equivalent of the BBC, broke a major story . They discovered that RBC - Royal Bank of Canada - had done something cruel and unusual even by banking standards . It was obliging junior staff to train a group of temporary foreign workers , who would then be given the staff's jobs . Just after the first report was aired, according to the website Canadaland, something odd happened : journalists preparing to expand on the investigation were summoned to a conference call with Amanda Lang, CBC's senior business correspondent and a star presenter . The reporters she spoke to say she repeatedly attempted to scuttle the story, dismissing it as trivial and dull . They were astonished . But not half as astonished as when they discovered the following, unpublished facts . First ,  that Lang had spoken at a series of events run or sponsored by RBC  - for which she appears, on one occasion, to have been paid around 15,000 Canadian dollars . Second , that she was booked to speak at an event sponsored by the outsourcing company the bank had hired to implement the cruel practice exposed by her colleagues . Third , that her partner is a board member at RBC . Lang then interviewed the bank's chief executive on her own show . When he dismissed the story as unfair and misleading , she did not challenge him . That evening she uncritically repeated his talking points on CBC's main current affairs programme . Her interests, again, were not revealed . Then she wrote a comment article for the Globe and Mail newspaper suggesting that her colleagues' story arose from an outdated suspicion of business, was dangerous to Canada's interests, and was nothing but \"a sideshow\" . Here's what she said about the bank's employment practices:\"It's called capitalism, and it isn't a dirty word.\" Canadaland, which exposed Lang's conflicts last week, found that other journalists at the broadcaster were furious, but too frightened to speak on the record . But after CBC tried to dismiss the scandal as \"half-truths based on anonymous sources\" , Kathy Tomlinson, the reporter who had broken the story about the bank, bravely spoke publicly to the website . The following morning, staff in her office arrived to find this message spelt out in magnets on their fridge:\"Jesse Brown snitches get stitches\" . Jesse Brown is Canadaland's founder . CBC refused to answer my questions , and I have not had a response from Lang . It amazes me that she remains employed by CBC , which has so far done nothing but bluster and berate its critics . This is grotesque . But it's symptomatic of a much wider problem in journalism : those who are supposed to scrutinise the financial and political elite are embedded within it . Many belong to a service-sector aristocracy, wedded metaphorically (sometimes literally) to finance . Often unwittingly, they amplify the voices of the elite, while muffling those raised against it . A study by academics at the Cardiff School of Journalism examined the BBC Today programme's reporting of the bank bailouts in 2008 . It discovered that the contributors it chose were \"almost completely dominated by stockbrokers, investment bankers, hedge fund managers and other City voices . Civil society voices or commentators who questioned the benefits of having such a large finance sector were almost completely absent from coverage.\" The financiers who had caused the crisis were asked to interpret it . The same goes for discussions about the deficit and the perceived need for austerity . The debate has been dominated by political and economic elites , while alternative voices - arguing that the crisis has been exaggerated, or that instead of cuts, the government should respond with Keynesian spending programmes or taxes on financial transactions, wealth or land- have scarcely been heard . Those priorities have changed your life : the BBC helped to shape the political consensus under which so many are now suffering . The BBC's business reporting breaks its editorial guidelines every day by failing to provide alternative viewpoints . Every weekday morning, the Today programme grovels to business leaders for 10 minutes . It might occasionally challenge them on the value or viability of their companies, but hardly ever on their ethics . Corporate critics are shut out of its business coverage - and almost all the rest . On BBC News at Six, the Cardiff researchers found, business representatives outnumbered trade union representatives by 19 to one . \"The BBC tends to reproduce a Conservative, Eurosceptic, pro-business version of the world,\" the study said . This, remember, is where people turn when they don't trust the corporate press . While the way in which the media handle the stories that are covered is bad enough , the absence of coverage is even worse . If an issue does not divide the main political parties , it vanishes from view , though the parties now disagree on hardly anything . Another study reveals a near total collapse of environmental coverage on ITV and BBC news: it declined from 2.5% (ITV) and 1.6% (BBC) of total airtime in 2007 to, respectively, 0.2% and 0.3% in 2014 . There were as many news stories on these outlets about Madeleine McCann in 2014 - seven years after her disappearance - as there were about all environmental issues put together . Those entrusted to challenge power are the loyalists of power . They rage against social media and people such as Russell Brand, without seeing that the popularity of alternatives is a response to their own failures: their failure to expose the claims of the haut monde, their failure to enlist a diversity of opinion, their failure to permit the audience to see that another world is possible . If even the public sector broadcasters parrot the talking points of the elite , what hope is there for informed democratic choice? o Twitter: @georgemonbiot .

            "input": "Obama and Cameron's 'solutions' for cybersecurity will make the internet worse. The current state of the US and UK governments' ass-backwards approach to cybersecurity was on full display this week- culminating with British Prime Minister David Cameron and President Obama meeting to discuss the issue at the White House on Friday . When it comes to cybersecurity , it seems the UK and US want to embrace every crazy idea except what we know actually works . The UK's Cameron suggested earlier in the week he wants to outlaw certain forms of encryption , which could potentially lead to some of the world's most popular messaging apps (like iMessage and WhatsApp) being banned in the UK . That speech had been ridiculed from all angles for the past few days, with various experts labeling it a nightmare for Internet security- on par with authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China- and economically devastating for the British information technology industry . Meanwhile, the White House has proposed a huge expansion of penalties under the highly-controversial law that was used to prosecute Reddit co-founder and privacy rights advocate Aaron Swartz . If passed , the administration's proposal could further criminalize mundane Internet activity - for example, potentially allowing for a ten-year jail sentence for sharing your HBO GO password - all to supposedly target foreign hackers that the law would likely never reach . Less than 24 hours before Cameron-Obama the meeting , the Guardian published a secret report based on previously unreleased Snowden documents showing that the US government is fully aware that encryption is vital for security, and that the government risked leaving themselves vulnerable if they didn't start implementing it on their own systems quicker . The British government likely knows this too : many of their employees use email encryption ; and UK even recommend citizens use encryption to protect their data on a government website . At the press conference after the meeting, Obama commendably didn't embrace Cameron's proposal when asked about it , and even Cameron seemed to at least appear to back off his own anti-encryption proclamation , saying he's \"not trying to enunciate some new doctrine.\" But just because Cameron's been proven to be technically illiterate and may be attempting to publicly back away from his most radical proposal , that doesn't mean that he won't later push forward . FBI director Jim Comey proposed similar legislation to Cameron's just a few months ago , and Cameron used eerily similar talking points in Washington on Friday as Comey did in late 2014 . Plus, the rest of Cameron's plan is downright scary for Internet privacy even without a formal encryption ban . And then there's the White House's so-called solution to the cybersecurity problem, which they unveiled earlier this week . President Obama introduced it saying we had to do something about incidents like the headline-grabbing Sony hack, or the juvenile hijacking of US Central Command's twitter account - but what he didn't say was that those proposals wouldn't have stopped those attacks at all . Part of the Obama administration's proposal would dramatically expand the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the oft-abused and notorious statute that the Justice Department used to threaten the late Internet activist Aaron Swartz with 35 years in jail . (Aaron later took his own life while awaiting trial .) The CFAA already has incredibly harsh penalties, so much so that there's been a movement for years to reduce them . And how the administration thinks increasing CFAA penalties is going to worry either North Korean hackers or ISIS sympathizers (or more likely pranksters) who take advantage of negligent password practices is anyone's guess . It would also put countless security researchers at further risk of prosecution, the exact type of people the government should consulting with before making these ill-thought proposals, not driving underground . At the same time ,  Congress has re-introduced their annual \"info-sharing\" cybersecurity bill , which is really just a thinly-veiled way to siphon off more of Americans' private data without court oversight . As EFF put it, the bill \"offered new authorities that could be abused by companies to spy on users, and offered broad legal immunity for disclosing the information obtained with the government . Sometimes they even granted companies the ability to 'hack back'... a perfect storm threatening our online privacy.\" The President's alternative bill is a bit less sweeping, but not by much . So, Congress and Obama seem to be finally on the same page about something: harsher penalties that won't reach the hackers they were worried about and invasive \"info-sharing\" that doesn't come close to solving existing problems . God forbid there be a full rebirth of the US-UK relationship, or that both sides of the Atlantic seek a full, two-state ban on encryption . Even full government gridlock would be better than that .",

            "input": "Can solar power replace oil in the Middle East? The rise of shale has posed a rare challenge to Middle Eastern oil, culminating in a global oil price war and moving OPEC members to slash profits to retain market share . But at a time when OPEC's hegemony over the oil markets has been challenged , let us not forget there is another abundant natural energy resource the Middle East possesses - the sun . The abundance of sunlight (and therefore solar power) offers Middle Eastern energy producers an opportunity to achieve first-move advantage in a market that appears to be the longer-term future of energy . In light of recent instability in oil markets, the importance of alternative renewable energies, particularly solar, has become all the more pronounced . The drop in oil prices has precipitated an efficiency rush in energy production in all producer nations . In the US, oil producers are leaving no stone unturned in the hunt to become as efficient and sustainable as possible . In Europe, there is a renewed push for renewable energy and some countries like the UK are also pursuing nuclear energy as a longer-term solution . In the Gulf, there are similar measures taking place to become more efficient in a more competitive energy market , and increasingly, they are turning to solar to achieve it . Domestic budgets . The Gulf states remains one of the biggest oil producers in the world, and make up the biggest exporting members of OPEC, especially Saudi Arabia . While some of these countries can afford to swallow current oil prices for now , they will nonetheless find it difficult to maintain their domestic budgets - all OPEC countries chose to cut prices in order to hold onto market share , this means slashing profit . It would not be unprecedented for these countries to encounter domestic trouble . The other, more serious concerns for these major oil producers, is the increasing consumer demand in their own countries . In past decades, the region has been able to sustain luxury alongside completely inefficient energy policies through government subsidies . But the entire energy outlook for the region is changing rapidly . Rising populations, a growing middle class, industry diversification and increasing consumerism has turned a number of countries in the Gulf region into major energy consumers . In Saudi Arabia, oil accounts for over 65 percent of all electricity production , in Kuwait it is 71 percent , in Lebanon it is 94 percent and in Yemen it's an astonishing 100 percent . This represents an energy policy that is inefficient and in the long run - unsustainable . Saudi Arabia is the biggest petroleum consumer in the region , it is the world's second biggest consumer of total primary energy, 60 percent of which is petroleum-based . But most importantly, it paints a distressing future for the region's oil export industry . If consumer demand continues to grow , it will eventually result in downward pressure on oil exports and could start affecting subsidies . Without a robust and efficient energy balance in the region, it will inevitably lead to these producer nations becoming less profitable with a weaker export outlook . And with competitors in the oil market like Russia, Iran and the North American shale, this is a long-term dynamic that will undermine Middle East's global energy dominance . However ,  the possibilities associated with harnessing Middle Eastern solar energy could be a game-changer . Solar is becoming much cheaper to invest in, and now has an established and ever improving infrastructure . Substantial investment in solar will act as a shield for the region's more valued commodity; oil . Saudi Arabia alone for example, could have made$43.8bn in additional oil revenue in 2013 were it not for its spiralling domestic consumption . It also would have acted as a massive stimulus to the country's finances . Earlier this year, Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, announced it would be making solar energy investments across the country in an attempt to diversify the country's energy supplies . It is also expected to conserve the country's oil resources primarily for export . It has been a slow process but is nonetheless an important one for the future of the solar energy sector . One of the biggest success variables for any solar energy project is not just investment, but location . The Middle East's solar industry is one of the most economically sustainable and acts as the best conserver of the region's oil resources . Investment opportunity . It is also a very strong investment opportunity for those looking to invest in a sustainable, long-term energy sector with a ready market and significantly lower start-up costs then depleting energy exploration . But these new developments would also have another important advantage for the Middle East; a cleaner environment . The use of petroleum for electricity generation has made the Middle East's air quality one of the poorest in the world . Twenty-nine of the world's most polluted cities are in the MENA region . Recent energy challenges could have very costly consequences for the region if left unaddressed , but they could also reap huge rewards if met with robust energy reforms and additional investment in alternative energies, especially solar . And there are positive signs for the region . Saudi Arabia alone has announced a $109bn investment plan to generate a third of its electricity . Qatar has also made solar energy agreements with major renewable energy companies as part of its commitments to the Solar GCC alliance . How these measures materialise over the next decade or so remains to be seen , but there is room for optimism . What's more , the Middle East's unrivalled solar potential means that theoretically, it can become more then a just a world leader in fossil fuel production , it can become a world leader in renewable energy production as well .",

            "input": "CIA interrogations report: Feinstein offers aid and comfort to enemy, stabs heroes, allies in the back. Programing Alert : Author Ralph Peters will be a guest on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity\" on December 9 at 10pm ET . Tuesday's willful, unnecessary and gratuitously destructive release of the one-sided \"torture report\" at the insistence of outgoing Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.(backed by the White House) amounts to nothing less than providing aid and comfort to the enemy in wartime . Can anyone cite one practical good accomplished by releasing this gratuitously destructive report at this time? Will revealing successful practices make us more secure? No . The report provides a propaganda windfall for Islamist fanatics . Will it benefit our allies? No . It exposes those who took great risks to help us in the wake of 9/11 . Will it \"set the record straight?\" No . It distorts the record grotesquely in the interests of political correctness, blame-shifting and short-term political advantage . Over the decades, I've respected Senator Feinstein, even when disagreeing with her . Thus ,  I'm far more shocked by her self-serving release of this report than by anything the CIA did to protect us . One can only conclude that the senator and her acolytes are attempting not to reform our intelligence practices but to re-write their own role in what transpired . The senator and her colleagues (from both parties) were briefed in detail on every activity field agents took to protect us from further attacks . The senator and her colleagues (as well as the Department of Justice) approved every one of those practices . Now , the senator's saying,\"Even if we knew, we didn't know.\" Perhaps she is, indeed, suffering a much-delayed attack of conscience , but the awareness that the incoming Republican-majority Congress would never release such a biased report surely plays a role . And is it an accident that the report's release--the stuff of commanding headlines--has been timed for the day that Professor \"Americans-are-stupid\" Jonathan Gruber testifies on Capitol Hill about ObamaCare? What a monstrous betrayal it is to compromise our agents and our allies just to shove a lackey's testimony below the fold in tomorrow-morning's newspapers ... As for those supposedly horrendous actions taken by CIA personnel to convince blood-encrusted terrorists that cooperation might be the wisest course, they may have been harsh , but the times and our enemies were and are immeasurably harsher . But torture? What the Islamic State and its ilk do to their captives is torture . They shrink from nothing . We shrink from the thought of a terrorist gasping for breath . Senator Feinstein and her supporters argue that the American people have a \"right to know,\" but they don't know the American people . Living too long in a bubble with fellow members of the cultural elite, they have no sense of how the average American feels about terrorists who fly passenger aircraft into skyscrapers or who gleefully behead innocent captives in video clips . Far from being mortified by water-boarding or sleep deprivation (for working Americans sleep deprivation is a normal state of affairs from holding down two jobs and multiple shifts to feed their families during the Reign of Obama) , the folks I know back home in the Pennsylvania coal towns would skin terrorists alive then get out the salt shaker . My people weren't upset by water-boarding . They were upset-- infuriated-- by the collapse of the Twin Towers and the deaths of 3,000 Americans . Of course ,  the release of this report just now-- which may lead to the deaths of more Americans, as the senator has been warned-- is another sign of the Obama administration's desperation . Team Obama's genius for failure in every policy field, foreign or domestic, has left the administration's inner circle frantic to deflect attention from its parade of deceptions, derelictions and disasters . About the only thing left to them is to exhume, yet again, the mutilated-by-the-left corpse of the George W  Bush administration . For Team Obama, with its conviction that America's at the root of every evil, Bush is responsible for the Crucifixion, the Black Death, the Holocaust and Country music . But the average Americans so disdained by this White House(and by Professor Gruber) want to know what President Obama has done for them . And unless one belongs to an arcane interest group , the answer is \"Nothing.\" Even if we grant her the noblest intentions , Senator Feinstein has betrayed our country and its defenders . Will she accept responsibility for the aftermath of this report's release? The president certainly won't . Should things go wrong , the White House will give the senator a back-massage by a bus this holiday season . Our enemies would gladly exterminate every man, woman and child in the United States . Senator Feinstein just handed them a gift . But the president wrapped it .",

I love America and believe each citizen needs to be involved in charting the future of our nation . Our churches have compartmentalized faith and kept it from influencing our nation for far too long, just as most of America's leaders compartmentalize their faith from their politics . Today, our nation has become a product of this sad reality . We need to return to the conviction that a faith worth believing in is a faith worth dying for . Our faith cannot be checked at the door like a piece of luggage at an airport . The Time is Now . The time is now for our nation to recognize that we cannot fix ourselves . The signs of our brokenness are glistening in our dark world . The blatant destruction of the family, the killing of unborn children, the continuing racial tension, the rebellion against authority, the ongoing reality of poverty, the rising threat of our security, the clear attacks against religious liberty and, of all things, the arrogance to believe the highest court in our land can rule on what the Bible says is genuine marriage testify to just how broken we really are . Where Do We Go From Here? 1 \\. We need to repent . Repentance occurs when we have a change of mind . This change of mind changes our behavior . As a nation, we need to personally and collectively repent of our sins . We need to ask God for His free gift of forgiveness for the sins we have committed, resulting in change from that point forward . 2 \\. We need to return to God . America is a nation that was built on a deep belief in God . A desire for religious liberty was the catalyst for the beginning of our nation . While we have gone through ups and downs in our history , God has been very merciful and gracious toward us . It is time to return to God . It is time to stop making every issue about ourselves, posturing to ensure we get our way . God's way is the only way . There is no other . Anything less than God's way diminishes our happiness, our fulfillment and even our liberty . 3 \\. We need our churches to wake up . Churches all over our nation need to wake up from the slumber we find ourselves in as a whole . We need pastors to return to their spiritual calling, be rekindled by the fire of God and declare the hope we have in the Lord . As a pastor goes, so goes the church . As our churches go, so goes our nation . The evidence is overwhelming of just how broken we are as a nation . This is the greatest hour for our churches to rise up . Never more has America needed our churches to lead the way forward , serving and influencing our communities with compassion and hope . 4 \\. We need a spiritual awakening . In our history, there have been seasons of spiritual awakening that have influenced the spiritual state of our nation dramatically . Lives were changed and subcultures became different . Spiritual awakening is our greatest need in America today . There are many who have probably never even thought about this need . Others may feel we have gone too far . But I want to assure you : God can do more in a moment than we can ever do in a lifetime . Wherever you are in life, would you just stop for one moment and pray something like this:\"God, would you please bring spiritual awakening to America? It is our greatest need.\"? America's greatest need is the next great move of God . This is our hope .",

How can he ignore the overwhelming and ever-increasing evidence? How can he insist that his subordinates continue their buffoonish insistence that Islamist terror has nothing to do with Islam and that they--secularized Christians and non- observant Jews--know Islam's character better than Muslims themselves? It's easy . President Obama and his commissars fit the longstanding pattern of behavior (insistence, denial, castigation) that the hard left has embraced for generations . In the mid-20th century, leftists, bereft of God and desperate for a new faith, insisted for decade after decade that Comrade Stalin was a paragon of political virtues and that the Soviet Union was Utopia . All reports of purges, terror, man-made famines and the Gulag were fabrications of capitalists and their servants . Even after Premier Khrushchev revealed Stalin's crimes to the world, hardcore leftists excused or ignored the truth, insisting still that Red terror wasn't terror and that Communism was a movement (religion?) of peace and progress, that humankind's hope still waited in the east . Only the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet collapse briefly sobered a few on the extreme left--the milieu in which our president spent his youth and pre-presidency adulthood . But leftists need a utopia, a fantasy heaven on earth, to comfort them and to give their lives purpose . Robbed of the Soviet dream, the forlorn left was in need of a new redeemer . Welcome, Comrade Usama! The left--and young Barack Obama -- already saw Islam as an oppressed religion, the noble faith of the wretched of the earth , while casting Christianity and Judaism in the role once occupied by capitalist imperialists: that of oppressors . Bin Laden gave the left a new torch to carry . While it remained necessary to condemn terrorism in public , the left simultaneously justified it in a globalized version of the Marxist construct of a class struggle . Really, didn't American deserve 9/11? Islamism fit the left like a tailored glove . Just as Western Reds didn't need to endure life in the Soviet Union (\"Pass the foie gras, Comrade!\") . , so today's leftwing cadres need not actually live in the Middle East or North Africa . From the comfort of Cambridge or the splendor of California's coast, they can rationalize radical Islam, a creed that would, if imported here, exterminate them as surely as Comrade Stalin would have purged the old American left . The staff of Charlie Hebdo? Stalin would have killed those pranksters, too . The only difference is that \"Uncle Joe\" would have gotten them all . When you take the long view, it's disheartening(to put it mildly) that the Western left simply cannot live without dreaming of an impossible utopia to be imposed by one ideology or another on the rest of us . Radical Islam? It's a \"religion of peace.\" Just as Soviet Communism was an ideology of peace, justice and brotherhood . So President Obama's just playing by the time-honored rules, substituting Muhammad for Josef Stalin or Mao: Never criticize the Party . Ignore the facts . If the facts can't be ignored , deny or twist them . No matter what, stick to the script (let them laugh for now, they'll see soon enough ...). And anyone who strays one inch must be neutralized , whether as a Trotskyist yesteryear or slandered as an Islamophobe today . The left's existential bleakness and its resultant need to embrace horrid schemes for man-made heavens on earth form a peerless argument for humankind's need for religion . In the absence of belief there is only a desert of the soul . And Red terror gives way to Islamist terror . The Communist International cedes pride of place to the global caliphate . Comrade Stalin fades into Comrade Muhammad . Truth is malleable . Facts are nuisances to be exterminated, along with troublesome people . Middle-class notions of freedom must be shouted down . The rule of the intellectuals must be imposed . Never, ever criticize the cause . Deny everything . Never forget that Islam's a religion of peace . The future is ours, Comrades .",

Since the advent of modern \"anti-poverty\" programs 50 years ago, according to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation, \"U.S  taxpayers have spent over $22 trillion on anti-poverty programs.\" And yet the poverty rate remains essentially unchanged . One might conclude then that if you've spent 50 years and $22 trillion trying without success to fix something , perhaps you're doing it wrong and should try a different approach . If the goal is more successful people who can take care of themselves , incentives must be put in place to encourage people to make right decisions . First on any anti-poverty help-the-middle-class list must be a stable family life . A two-parent home where adults love and are committed to each other and in which their children feel loved creates a climate in which moral and economic values like hard work, self-control, personal responsibility and accountability flourish . To help achieve this, parents must be educated and they must have jobs . Government can make this easier by reforming the tax code to remove the \"marriage penalty,\" which in too many instances charges higher taxes to married couples than to singles, and increasing the exemption deductible for children, which might make it possible for one parent to stay home with young children; allow college tuition to be deductible to incentivize more people to obtain a college education and ease their debt upon graduation . Better yet, scrap the tax code entirely and replace it with a flat tax or consumption tax that allows people to save, invest and spend more of the money they earn . Economically, there must be a change in attitude from working to pay bills, to working to build wealth . Bills, like the poor, we will always have with us, but in building wealth one moves toward independence and personal satisfaction that pays dividends in liberty and personal choice . Government should also make it easier for people to move in pursuit of new opportunities . My late grandfather worked for the B and O Railroad for 50 years . He retired with a pension, a gold-plated watch and a lifetime train pass . Those days are long gone . People need to be ready to move to places in pursuit of opportunities that can bring economic and career growth . Earning more produces more in taxable income and more income means more tax money for federal and state treasuries . My wife and I have moved eight times (so far) and each move provided new opportunities, more experience and eventually higher incomes . Here's another suggestion for Sen  Ernst and the new Republican Congress . Let the Democrats focus on misery, poverty and failure . You promote hope, opportunity and achievement . Begin featuring people with stories to tell of how they overcame difficult circumstances -- from poverty, welfare, addiction, single motherhood, and so on -- and are now independent, strong and if not prosperous, then at least free of their addiction to government . Leaders should inspire others to follow examples of people who have succeeded in life . Instead ,  the Democrats' mantra has been that the poor and middle class can't succeed without government help . If that were true , the money spent on programs aimed at the poor and middle class would have succeeded by now . It's long past time for a new direction and for a new \"song\" with different words . In the month we observe the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr , how about \"We HAVE overcome\"?",

Last Tuesday, a ninth-grader at John F  Kennedy High School in Paterson, N.J , was caught on video throwing his 62-year-old teacher to the ground and wrestling with him in order to retrieve his cellphone , which the teacher had confiscated . Teachers at the school allow cellphones to be used for educational purposes in the classroom , but they may take them and hold them until the end of class if a student appears to be using his phone for any other purpose . Granted , the boy may have demonstrated problems controlling his impulses in other settings, too , but the video of his attack has resulted in national attention . And that's because it isn't the first dramatic example of how attached to our phones we have become . Last year, a Houston woman was shot by a mugger when she refused to hand over her cellphone . She survived , and she later asserted that she had done the right thing . In 2013, a 22-year-old man was killed by a train when he tried to retrieve the cellphone he had dropped on the tracks . Without giving a great deal of thought to the psychological implications, our species has deployed mobile technology very quickly, in a very widespread manner . One reason is that the marketplace embraced smartphones in an astounding way  -- as if our phones and their apps are a lock-and-key fit with our psyches . According to one source, there are 7 billion mobile devices on earth, one for almost each person . What is \"in\" our cellphones that would lead people to attack others or risk death to keep them? I would argue that the phones absorb and record our thoughts and intentions so dramatically that we become unconsciously convinced they are \"parts of us.\" Why else would so many people hesitate even to leave a room without taking their cellphones with them? Why would they interrupt meetings and family time to check them? Why would young people be opting to spend their money on newer, faster ones, instead of on clothing? Why would there be so much interest in personalizing the sounds they make, the apps they hold and the cases that hold them? I contend we have already crossed the Rubicon, almost irrevocably incorporating technology into our psyches in a way that makes us part flesh and blood, part hardware . The fact that the hardware is outside our bodies(for now) does not mean the integration has not occurred . We are psychologically magnetized to our devices . That's why some people will fight for them, and even die for them . The selfie has become so ubiquitous that it no longer seems bizarre to see someone smiling into a cellphone or sticking out her tongue or making a sad face -- acting-- and then snapping a photo . And these images are then sent not only to her supposed \"friends,\" who may number in the hundreds, but also to her unconscious mind -- reinforcing the idea that she is what her cellphone records her to be . Take away the cellphone and, in some measure, she believes she disappears . She feels she dies a little bit, or more than a little bit, psychologically . The business of selling \"selfie sticks\"-- telescoping rods that hold a cellphone far enough away to facilitate a really good shot-- is robust enough to make many retailers place large kiosks of them near the checkout register . Cellphones, you might say, are growing arms . Ours apparently aren't long enough . This is just the beginning . Cellphones will soon be able to determine whether you are looking at the content on their screens, rather than looking away . They will demand attention . The extent to which we own them versus them owning us will be increasingly in doubt . Make no mistake : While technology can be good when harnessed for the good (raising money for charity occurs to me) , there will be hell to pay for giving so little thought to the downside . That downside likely includes an epidemic of narcissism in young people, increased rates of anxiety and dramatically decreased feelings of autonomy . Because to the extent that one's self-image is outsourced to a mobile device, it is no more deeply rooted than that . Bill Hemmer and Martha MacCallum bring you the news that matters to you!",

            "input": "Sydney Hostage Crisis: Australia has lost its innocence. Australia is known as the \"lucky country.\" It was a phrase first coined in 1964 by social critic Donald Horne, and has come to represent the visceral feelings of both Australians, and visitors to the nation . It is seen as a reflection of a high standard of living, and a geographical insulation from the bad actors of the world theater . But ten days out from Christmas, Australia has lost its innocence . On a day of brilliant blue skies, the terrorism of the post-9/11 world finally arrived on Australian soil , taking hold of city streets . A man wielding a gun and an Islamic flag took customers and staff hostage at a cafe in central Sydney . As a native of Sydney, home for the holidays, safe and sound but shaken and furious, December 15 is a day that will forever be seared into my mind . I've been to the Lindt Cafe ; in fact ,  I once worked across the street from it . Emotions have run high here all day -- from fear to anger to a desire for vengeance . I never expected this in Sydney . The profoundly shocking standoff with all its disruptions to city life has struck fear in Sydneysiders, unaccustomed to these types of events . The mood in Sydney is one of fear and uncertainty . Until now, Australian authorities have been flawless in preventing terror attacks on Australian soil . They have been aggressive in their pursuit of intelligence and would-be terrorists , foiling plot after plot . September saw the biggest anti-terrorism operation in Australia's history , involving up to 800 police in coordinated raids , sparked by intelligence reports that Islamic State supporters were planning to seize a random member of the public and behead them live on camera . Yet , it was inevitable that one would finally slip through the cracks , and Monday Sydney joined the ranks of cities such as New York, London and Madrid as the latest victim of what appears to be Islamic terrorism . Monday's distressing events have renewed Australians' concerns about Islamist objectives, and a growing Islamic presence in the country . Some Australians recognize that this likely terrorist attack is a result of the poor immigration decisions of Australian governments, both conservative and liberal, over the last four decades . A lack of liberty, an abandonment of reason, the imposition of Sharia on Muslims and non-Muslims, as well as the treatment of women are just some of the serious moral problems within the Muslim world . Islamist views are incompatible with the liberty enjoyed by Australians and Americans . Interestingly, Monday's events have also prompted Australians to revisit their gun laws . With Islamic supremacism a mainstream interpretation of Islam, deeply rooted in Islamic scripture and endorsed by many of Islam's most influential scholars, Australians are beginning to understand the nature of the Islamic threat , and studying their own weaknesses in its wake . The United Kingdom has had two beheadings of members of the public in the last two years, with neither police nor civilians able to prevent it . It also has prohibitive gun laws . Australians are looking to America, and not the UK for guidance . With this sort of threat, the normal calculus of a civilized society with a small, armed (or unarmed) police force upon which the citizens are forced to rely, no longer adds up . It is unsurprising that home-grown terrorism is most rampant in nations with strict gun control . It is a reality that Australia's powerful anti-gun lobby seems to wish to ignore . It is times like these that Americans should be thankful for their Second Amendment, and crush any effort or force seeking to weaken or remove it . Right now, they are the envy of a growing number of Australians that wish they were armed . Australia will never be the same again . Sydney just lost a little of its shine .",

            "input": "The Paris unity march shows we must protect freedom of expression, not curtail it further. I was just one Australian face in a human sea of more than one and half million Parisians yesterday . I was trying to comprehend what I was a part of when the placard thrust in front of my eyes made it clear : \"La liberte d'expression n'a pas de religion\"- freedom of expression has no religion . This was a rally to defend the essential global human right to free expression . A right that should not be bound by religious, cultural or political strictures . We were marching to remember the victims of the Charlie Hebdo newsroom massacre and the Kosher grocery store siege . We were marching in sympathy with those in mourning who joined us . We were marching in defiance, determined to rise above the fear and chaos the terrorists inflicted on our city . But ,  overwhelmingly, we marched to defend our right to freely express our views . The main march stretched three kilometres between Place de la Republique and Place de la Nation, tracking down Boulevard Voltaire . When I cried \"Je suis Charlie, nous somme Charlie!\", it was in the spirit of the French philosopher Voltaire's revolutionary words:\"I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.\" The props of the rally - giant pencils supporting the French flag, a flood of demonstrators holding pens aloft and bibs emblazoned with the faces of the massacred Charlie Hebdo staff - told the story . Paris has been my home for a year . I am a research fellow with the World Editors Forum and the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers which is based in the city . It's a long way from the University of Wollongong in Australia , where I am on staff as a journalism academic . But the principle of freedom of expression we were marching to defend binds journalists, writers and artists, and by extension all citizens, globally . It transcends national borders, distance, culture, language, class and religion . That's why, as we marched, we saw Paris residents hanging models of pencils and banners carrying free speech slogans from their balconies . And it's why we paused to listen while a little African girl bellowed \"Je suis Charlie!\" from a third story window at her mother's side . We were a calm sea of over 1.5 million people pouring through the grand boulevards of central Paris . Led by the families of those killed and over 40 world leaders who walked with linked arms, it was a significant moment in history, a moment triggered by outrage at the act of terrorists who massacred journalists and cartoonists in the middle of a weekly editorial meeting and ordinary citizens doing their shopping . It was also a moment fuelled by a collective determination to display unity and defiance in the face of terror and fear . The attack on Charlie Hebdo and the climate of fear and anxiety it created are, sadly, regular occurrences in countries such as Iraq, Syria, Pakistan and Mexico, where journalists are frequent targets . The western media too often turns a blind eye to the murder of journalists elsewhere . The Paris unity march represents a watershed moment in the struggle to protect journalists and defend freedom of expression globally . Kalashnikov-wielding terrorists took the fight into the heart of a newsroom in one of western Europe's biggest cities . If that doesn't wake up complacent democracies to the need to vigorously defend the right to report , nothing will . Once the news cycle moves on from Paris and the cries of \"Je suis Charlie\" fade, we must harness the levels of public support and political will to enact significant and lasting change globally . We must be on guard against the already audible attempts to justify a further curtailment of media and internet freedoms in the interests of national security in the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks . The threats posed to investigative journalism by mass surveillance, data retention and the criminalisation of reporting certain information under anti-terrorism legislation are already significant . Especially in Australia . It would be an enormous tragedy if the lasting legacy of the Charlie Hebdo massacre was ultimately a further undermining of privacy and freedom of expression rights . Let us honour the victims and survivors of the Paris terrorist attacks by finding a sustainable balance between the need for anti- terrorism measures against our collective human right to freely express our views . As the murdered editor-in-chief of Charlie Hebdo, Stephane Charbonnier, told Le Monde in 2011:\"I'd rather die standing than live on my knees.\"",

            "input": "There is no debate about torture. The Senate Intelligence Committee's scathing torture report not only described the brutality of the CIA's interrogation methods, but also demonstrated their ineffectiveness . Led by ex-Vice President Dick Cheney, former Bush administration officials have rushed to the airwaves to defend the CIA . \"I would do it again in a minute,\" Cheney said on NBC's Meet the Press , claiming that Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (EITs) produced \"actionable intelligence that kept us safe from attacks\" . Cheney & Co may not win the debate , but they have succeeded in muddying the waters . That is unfortunate because, beneath their bombastic caricatures of the torture programme, there's more agreement than first appears among people who actually count . Aside from former officials trying to save their reputations, it isn't one camp saying torture didn't \"work\" and one saying it did . Rather , it's one camp saying it didn't, and the other saying \"we have no idea but did it anyway\" . On several key points, the CIA is closer in substance to the Senate report than to its loudest defenders . 'Unprepared' for torture . The Senate report found that the CIA was \"unprepared\" to operate a detention and interrogation system . The Agency's written response to the report says;\"We fully agree\" - the CIA had \"no cadre of trained and experienced interrogators, little experience handling and moving prisoners, and no core competency in prison management . [...] The Agency had too few analysts and linguists with the expertise required to support[a detention] programme\" . In other words ,  there is no dispute that the programme was started and run on the fly . A critical finding of the Senate report was that torturing detainees did not yield otherwise unobtainable actionable intelligence . CIA director, John O Brennan, admitted that the agency \"has not concluded that it was the use of EITs that allowed us to obtain useful information from detainees\" . So while the CIA still maintains that it gained valuable intelligence from detainees , it is not saying the abusive methods produced it . The Senate report also describes how the CIA sought out two psychiatrists, James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, to construct the torture programme instead of actual experienced interrogators, on the assumption that long-established humane and lawful interrogation methods wouldn't work . In its response, the CIA acknowledged that it had to look beyond the agency to find experts on \"non-standard means of interrogation\" since it was not an area of expertise that CIA officers or the US government possessed . The CIA called Mitchell and Jessen's background \"so unique\" that the agency \"would have been derelict had[it] not sought them out when it became clear that CIA would be heading into the uncharted territory of the programme\" . In other words ,  the torture programme was so out of whack with what professional interrogators do that the CIA had to go outside the US government to find people to do it . There still are important areas of disagreement between the Senate report and the CIA . The CIA is too protective of its own to acknowledge the full import of its descent into torture or to disavow the programme entirely . But the agency - unlike its loudest defenders - is not endorsing torture as a means of gaining intelligence or keeping the country safe . To be sure , basing the case against torture on its total ineffectiveness is a risky proposition . Torture produces a lot of information and while victims frequently make things up to ease their suffering , they may also on occasion say things of some value . That's why it is important to remember that torture is illegal under any circumstances regardless of its utility . But in a democracy, the strength of legal norms depends partly on their acceptance by the public . So while the public shouldn't have to be persuaded that barbaric methods fail to make them safer , doing so reinforces their illegality . The flurry of media appearances by Cheney and other torture defenders has created a false sense that there is a genuine divide over whether torture\"works\" . But neither the CIA nor professional interrogators actually say that . So while we can continue to debate other aspects of the CIA programme , including whether those responsible should be sanctioned , let's stop pretending that there are two legitimate sides to this particular story .",

            "input": "Yes, too many of us are in pointless jobs - but don't despair. In his usual prescient fashion, Guy Debord once lamented that \"young people everywhere have been allowed to choose between love and a garbage disposal unit . Everywhere they have chosen the garbage disposal unit.\" The Situationists' vision of the future was not, as I'm sure you've guessed, an optimistic one , but it's nice to see that their spirit is alive and well on the London underground . \"How can one even begin to speak of dignity in labour when one secretly feels that one's job should not exist?\" a poster asks , as part of a campaign called #bullshitjobs devised by the anarchist magazine Strike! Another poster reads:\"The moral and spiritual damage that comes from the situation is profound . It is a scar on our collective soul . Virtually no one talks about it.\" And a third:\"It's as if someone were out there making up pointless jobs for the sake of keeping us all working.\" Just what every commuter needs on their first day back at work, you might think . But I love these subvertisements, mainly because they are right . No one talks about the soul-crushing sadness experienced by the chronically exhausted and unfulfilled hordes . Forget the garbage disposal : we're in urgent need of an army of pooper-scooper-wielding refuseniks , because bullshit jobs are everywhere . Of course , complaining about any of this or doing something as daring as opting out finds you guilty of the most conspicuous of crimes against capitalism: laziness . Or a suspicious lack of ambition, resulting in the label of \"scrounger\" if you're working class and that of \"pampered entitled millennial with no moral backbone\" if you're middle class . But don't despair : humans have an incredible capacity for survival . There are ways to endure the pointlessly mundane jobs that many of us do . Here are my tips :. One of the most level-headed people I know sets very little store in his job when it comes to defining himself as a human being . Instead ,  it's the things he does outside of work that he regards as his main means of personal fulfilment . Guy Debord regarded maximum pleasure as the central aim of any revolution , so start your own personal one, via music or reading or sex or anything that you enjoy doing creatively . Then pour your soul into these activities instead of thinking about work . If you can do one of these activities during working hours , even better . Not people who use the word \"facetime\" as a way of describing hanging out, or talk about things \"going forward\" . These people will be first up against the wall . I mean family and friends, people you love . Love is the answer (actually, anaesthetising yourself with drink and drugs is the answer , but unfortunately it's less slimming) . This sounds flippant but can actually be an effective means of delaying job- induced madness . A friend who worked stacking shelves in Tesco overnight was able to keep his sanity by pretending he was playing a game of foodstuff-sized Tetris . In a similar vein, you could see how many Cradle of Filth lyrics you can subtly weave into your customer service emails, wreak subtle psychological havoc upon your colleagues, or, if you're a hairdresser , deliberately give everyone terrible haircuts for your own amusement (my hairdresser has been doing this for years) . The biggest modern lie is the one told by the Steve Jobses of this world : that, career-wise, we must do what we love in order to experience true happiness . It's a lovely thought but, unfortunately for the generation sold this nonsense by idealistic baby-boomers, a fulfilling job is a luxury, not a given . Instead , as some means of twisted compensation, we're offered slave wages, zero-hours contracts and made-up job titles . But as depressing as things look, it's important to keep hold of those youthful aspirations and harness them , if not for financial profit, then for sanity's sake . It's exhausting , I know, especially as in Britain we work the longest hours in Europe . You are right to be furious . We all are . In the words of the retro anarchist-punk soundbite dusted off by Russell Brand:\"Let's have a revolution, yeah?\" (At least after a short nap .) Let's continue to campaign for better and more flexible working hours, wages that people can actually survive on, and freedom from harassment and exploitation . Let's vote . Let's join our unions . Let's take the bastards to tribunal (whoops, no legal aid) . Because if you're going to do a bullshit job , you might as well get what you can out of it .",

            "input": "Torture is a crime, time to end the impunity. This week the world has seen headline after headline about the CIA's horrifying practise of systematic torture and cruelty : Mentions of \"rectal hydration\" and rape threats, sleep and sensory deprivation, forced nudity, stress positions, subjection to cold temperatures, food deprivation, hanging from bars, confinement in a \"coffin size\" box, hooding, and physical assaults ; a man left shackled and naked to die overnight in a secret CIA facility in Afghanistan ; psychologists contracted to design the best ways to break the human spirit ; doctors ensuring that victims were fit to endure more torture . These were violations of the most fundamental human rights and crimes under international law . But still, no promises to bring any of those responsible to justice . It has been known for years that the US turned to torture as part of its response to the crime against humanity that was committed on September 11, 2001 . Today, the cruelty carried out in the CIA secret detention programme run under authority granted by President George W Bush still has the power to shock and sicken . While the CIA may have exceeded its authority and lied to him , he still had a part to play . But we must not forget that behind the text of the summary report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the details contained within, are cases of real people . People whose lives have been broken , whose humanity was forgotten under this state-sanctioned programme . The case of Abu Zubaydah has long been known . Amnesty International first raised its concerns with the US government in April 2002 . He was the first person to be taken into CIA custody considered by the agency to have high intelligence value . Abu Zubaydah was effectively treated as a human guinea pig to test the CIA's emerging interrogation regime . He was subjected to a range of torture methods, including being waterboarded multiple times . The SSCI summary adds some new chilling details . A July 15, 2002 cable sent by the interrogation team at \"Detention Site Green\", believed to be in Thailand, ended:\"In light of the planned psychological pressure techniques to be implemented, we need to get reasonable assurances that [Abu Zubaydah] will remain in isolation and incommunicado for the remainder of his life.\" CIA officers responded that \"all major players are in concurrence that [Abu Zubaydah] should remain incommunicado for the rest of his life\" . Then , after Abu Zubaydah had been subjected to 47 days of complete isolation, he was subjected to numerous \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" including physical assaults, stress positions, cramped confinement, white noise, and sleep deprivation \"in varying combinations, 24 hours a day for 17 straight days\" . Reports were constantly fed back to top authorities . Daily cables sent from \"Detention Site Green\" to CIA headquarters recorded that Abu Zubaydah frequently \"cried\", \"begged\", \"pleaded\", and \"whimpered\" . At times, he was \"hysterical\" and \"distressed to the level that he was unable to effectively communicate\" . Waterboarding sessions would result in \"hysterical pleas\" , and on at least one occasion, Abu Zubaydah \"became completely unresponsive\" until he received medical attention . Abu Zubaydah's ordeal is not yet over . After four and a half years in secret CIA custody he was transferred to Guantanamo , where he remains today . He has never been charged with any crime . The injustice continues . On August 5, 2002, at the same time that Abu Zubaydah was being tortured in Thailand, CIA headquarters approved an interrogation plan for Ridha al-Najjar at another secret facility, dubbed\"Detention Site Cobalt\" , believed to be the Salt Pit facility in Afghanistan . The interrogation plan for Najjar included isolation in total darkness, lowering the quality of his food, keeping him in cold temperatures, 24-hour-a-day loud music, shackling and hooding . Over one two-day period, he was left with his wrists handcuffed to an overhead bar for 22 hours a day in order to \"break his resistance\" . On September 21, 2002, his interrogators sent a cable describing Najjar as \"clearly a broken man\" and \"on the verge of complete breakdown\" . His detention and interrogation \"became the model\" for the treatment of detainees at that facility, according to the SSCI . Twelve years later, Najjar remains in US custody in Bagram, Afghanistan . He has never been charged or tried, and is still being denied his right to challenge his detention in court . A petition on his behalf is currently pending before the US Supreme Court . The psychological impact of such intense cruelty has devastated those subjected to it . According to the SSCI, many detainees\"exhibited psychological and behavioural issues, including hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, and attempts at self-harm and self-mutilation\" . Majid Khan, who was held in secret CIA custody for three and a half years before being transferred in 2006 to Guantanamo, where he remains today, is said to have engaged in numerous acts of self-harm, including\"attempting to cut his wrist on two occasions, to chew into his arm at the inner elbow, cut a vein in the top of his foot and into his skin at the elbow joint using a filed toothbrush\" . As the world struggles to comprehend the details in the summary it is important to remember all we've been given is a snapshot, a peek through the keyhole to the dark secrets hidden within . The report released yesterday is just a summary of a full report that runs to 6,700 pages . That report describes the detention and interrogation of 119 detainees held by the CIA . Senator Dianne Feinstein said that \"decisions will be made at a later date\" as to whether the whole report will be declassified and released . Amnesty International believes this should be done sooner rather than later, indeed should be set in motion now . The Senate committee also needs to address the fact that the US human rights violations and crimes went beyond torture . The CIA detainees were subjected to enforced disappearance  - which, like torture, is a crime under international law . No one has been brought to justice for these crimes . This accountability gap leaves the US squarely on the wrong side of its international obligations . Those responsible, no matter their current or previous level of office, must be brought to justice, along with those in other countries that colluded with the CIA to facilitate these programmes . December 10 marked 30 years since the adoption of the Convention Against Torture - an anniversary which the US would do well not to gloss over . The US ratified the treaty in 1994 . President Obama should make a public commitment to end the impunity being enjoyed by those who authorised and carried out the crimes committed in the CIA programmes of rendition, interrogation and detention . And victims should be offered redress  - most urgently they must be offered treatment to help them overcome the trauma to which they were unlawfully exposed . If they have committed crimes they should be prosecuted and punished for them , but as victims, they too deserve justice . Laying out a catalogue of abuses is not enough . There must be accountability too .",

            "input": "Torturing Muslims is an 'awesome' way to get things done. On December 9, the Senate Select Committee released a partial report of the horrifying, illegal torture tactics used by the CIA during the Bush administration . Some question the timing . I think the timing is perfect . We are now in a position to recall what past black activists, from Martin Luther King to Angela Davis to Muhammad Ali, knew when they spoke against the immoral actions of their nation in Vietnam . The protesters in Ferguson got a sneak peek, or a reminder, of this lesson in August, when Palestinians, who had experience with being shot at with US-made weaponry, advised US protesters on how to treat the searing pain of tear gas bombs (pour Coca-Cola directly over the eyes) . But recently, because of the quick succession of the failures to indict the killers of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, and then the release of the torture report, we are at a moment in which the link between our domestic terrorism and our international terrorism is being drawn for the rest of us . Immediately after the release of the report, many in the media did their best to claim that the release of this report was part of some wider conspiracy to demoralise Americans . The best example of this would be Fox News' Andrea Tantaros , who, in the middle of a conversation about the report, began shouting that \"The United States of America is awesome, we are awesome.\" She seemed positively indignant that the Obama administration was attempting to \"have this discussion to show us how we're not awesome\" . For those unfamiliar with the slang of US hipsters and teenagers, we generally use the \"awesome/not awesome\" binary to evaluate things like pizza, beer, or surfboards - not the moral character of a nation-state . But , if we are to adopt her method of expression , Tantaros seems to be forgetting that she is able to be on television in part because one or two generations ago, a few people declared that women not being able to participate in news media was not very \"awesome\" . She also forgets that a couple generations before that, her Greek last name would have prevented her from being considered\"white\" , and she thus would not have been allowed in front of a camera . Whether Tantaros accepts it or not, the history of equality in the US has been one of people deciding that things were not yet awesome, and taking it upon themselves to make them more awesome . But we should note that Tantaros was primarily angry at being forced to have a public conversation, and at being embarrassed that the world was seeing us have a discussion about our behaviour . \"This makes us look bad,\" she pleaded . \"And all this does is have our enemies laughing at us.\" Not only is torture illegal , but by US' own standards, it is ineffective . The CIA knew this . The 1992 US Army Field Manual on Interrogation explicitly advises that \"the use of force is a poor technique, as it yields unreliable results\", and can \"induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear\" . This ended up being true - we now know that one prisoner told the CIA that he was trying to recruit black Muslims in the US to attack gas stations . He later admitted that he made up the story,\"because he thought that's what interrogators wanted to hear\" . This year has also shown us that ineptitude can also happen at home, with our domestic police forces . The Ferguson Police Department has utterly failed to de-escalate tensions at every possible opportunity . We now know the officer that killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice was not fit to hold a pistol, much less a badge . In fact ,  a report by the Justice Department has shown that Cleveland police officers routinely use unjustified force in arrests, and fire their weapons \"carelessly\" , putting both innocent bystanders and themselves in danger . If the timing of the one-two punch of public revelations of anti-black racism and criminal torture do not convince us , then we can at least recognise a pattern in the people that are desperate to deny both . The torture report is available to anyone to view online, provided they are willing to wade through pages and pages of gruesome accounts . There is an account of putting a prisoner in a diaper, shackling him to the ceiling, and leaving him for days . One prisoner died of hypothermia after being chained, nearly naked, to a concrete floor . Many were sexually assaulted . Despite this, Republican Congressman Peter King attempted to wave these facts away, declaring that no harmful torture occurred . Instead ,  he brushed it off as merely a few\"people made to stand in awkward positions\" . This is the same Peter King who said that Eric Garner did not die because of a chokehold, but because he was overweight . It is also the same Peter King that implied that Garner, in his final moments, was lying about not being able to breathe . If Tantaros' reaction to the defiling of the \"awesomeness\" of the US seems childish , Peter King's reaction is worse . It is the rhetorical equivalent of sticking your fingers in your ears, and shouting \"nyah, nyah, I can't hear you\" - as your brother drowns beside you . And , as if we needed any clearer indication on how racism and callousness regarding the torture of non-whites were connected , we were given a clear reminder last week , when Facebook released a 23 second commercial about a feature of its service, and cast a Sikh man as the spokesperson . The video was immediately bombarded with angry comments calling the man an \"ISIL terrorist\", a \"raghead\", and a \"sand nigger\" . One commenter blasted Facebook itself, asking\"Why do you have a Muslim on this pic?\" When another user replied that he was a Sikh, the commenter responded:\"Same thing.\" We might chalk this up to ignorance : Our education system is focused on white European and US history . Most Americans don't know the difference between a friendly Sikh man and a scary Muslim terrorist . Actually, most Americans couldn't tell you the difference between a fatwah and a plate of chapati . But we should be more precise here - it's not that we don't know , it's that we don't want to know . But then again , separating \"good\" brown people from \"bad\" ones isn't the point, and wouldn't make a difference . For too many of us, anyone brown and bearded is automatically al-Qaeda, and deserves to be tortured and killed . Our understanding of humanity does not apply to anyone that can be mistaken for Muslim or Arab , and we excuse ourselves for this moral exception by constantly reminding ourselves that our country was attacked in 2001 . It's not that we can't know that we are terrorising black people . It's not that we can't know that the people we tortured in those prisons were people . We could, if we wanted to . But we don't want to . The events of the past few months have shown us that we are not up against a few crooked cops, a group of rogue rednecks, or a wacky news station . We are up against an empire of immorality that, in its fear, would rather shoot and waterboard the world, than to learn about it . If there is a true \"enemy\" , it is that Empire . It has been hiding in plain sight , and this year, it has revealed itself- in the mirror . As Tantaros says, it laughs at us . What we choose to do about that is up to us .",

            "input": "The trap of insecurity: Extrajudicial killings in Kenya. Over the years, Kenyan police have acquired a dubious reputation of being a source of insecurity instead of one of security . In many instances, the police represent clear, palpable and imminent danger to the lives of Kenyan citizens . The transformation of the police from a security institution into a bastion of insecurity didn't occur overnight , nor did it come as a surprise ; it was the inevitable outcome of a number of factors . Some of these factors are beyond their control . For instance ,  policemen are underpaid and ill-equipped to do their job ; others seem to be an institutional choice, such as the endemic corruption within the police force . Under the previous constitution, the police were at the beck and call of the executive , which used it as a tool of coercion to further its political goals . As a result , when confronted by a new security situation, the executive's default response has been to set up a \"special\" police unit to address the situation . In most cases, t he unit would operate under minimum oversight and maximum impunity . More than any other institution in the country, the police has deep institutional problems , but one of the most detrimental ones is its involvement in extrajudicial killings. Remarkably, this is not only a new phenomenon , but it is deeply entrenched with a clear pattern . In the 1990s, crime was on the rise in Kenya . In order to stem the high rates of carjacking and violent robberies, in 1995 the government formed a new police unit called the Flying Squad. This special unit was given the express authority to shoot any suspect on sight without due process . As a result, the unit was implicated in multiple and egregious extrajudicial killings , which they claimed was their way of dealing with the new security reality . In some cases, the police officers were caught shooting suspects after they had surrendered or were lying face down . The unit executed several innocent people in cold blood . The police command instead of seeing the unit's trigger-happy attitude as dangerous, celebrated it as the only \"medicine\" with which to treat spiralling crime . The late 1980s and 1990s saw deep economic problems, shrinking political space for dissent and increasing insecurity . This was the time when criminal gangs emerged and flourished . These gangs e stablished their \"spheres of influence\" , mostly in slum areas, where the state's presence was negligible . To establish loyalty from the community and enhance their legitimacy, these groups provided security for a token fee . To exert their superiority, from time to time, these groups engaged each other over \"territories\" and business interests . Among these groups were the Mungiki, the Taliban, the Kosovo boys, the Baghdad boys, Chinkororo, and the Kalenjin Warriors . Mungiki is a Kikuyu word for multitude . The organisation had both a cultural and political element to it . In the beginning of the group's existence, the social aspect was more prominent and it involved traditional Kikuyu beliefs in the god named Ngai. But as the organisation expanded, it began taking an overtly political posture , which brought them into confrontation with the state . Mungiki operated primarily in the Nairobi slums, in the Central Province and parts of the Rift Valley . In these areas, the group started providing the poor in slum areas with protection and social services for a fee . Refusal to pay the protection \" tax \" almost always resulted in violence and killings . In 2002, the Kenyan government banned 18 of these criminal gangs . The spread of Mungiki's influence forced the government in 2007 to establish a special police unit called Kwekwe which was tasked primarily with hunting down members of Mungiki . But Kwekwe's operation against the criminal group went too far . According to a National Commission on Human Rights 2008 report:\"Extrajudicial executions and other brutal acts of extreme cruelty have been perpetrated by the police against so-called Mungiki adherents and that these acts may have been committed pursuant to official policy sanctioned by the political leadership, the police commissioner and top police commander\" . HRW observed in 2008 that,\"The brutality of the police crackdown matched or even exceeded that of the Mungiki itself.\" Kenya has been in the crosshairs of the transnational jihadi movement . In the past, the fact that Kenya was seen as being firmly in the western sphere of influence made Kenya a target , with most of the incidents, including the 1998 US embassy attack, targeting western interests . However ,  after Kenya's intervention in Somalia in 2011, the country itself become a target . Terrorism activity in Kenya reached a peak with the attack on the Westgate shopping mall in September 2013 , when unidentified gunmen killed 67 people and injured almost 200 others . As a response to the growing terrorism threat, the Kenyan government created the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) in March 2003, following the 2002 attack on an Israeli-owned Mombasa hotel . This was also accompanied by the passage of Anti-Terrorism Act in 2012 . As part of the wider counterterrorism effort, the government also began a huge crackdo wn on the Somali and Muslim communities especially in Nairobi, parts of Northern Kenya and coastal Kenya . As the crackdown intensified, a number of extrajudicial killings of Muslim preachers took place, some in the coastal city of Mombasa . Most of the victims were suspected of having connections with Somalia's al-Shabab group . While in almost all the cases the police deny culpability , research by human rights organisations reveals the ATPU's involvement . In its August 2014 report,\"Kenya: Killings, disappearance by anti-terror police,\" HRW points to\" ...evidence of at least 10 cases of extrajudicial killings of terrorism suspects, some of whom were last seen in ATPU custody or had been threatened by the unit's officers after courts had released them\" . The Kenyan government has accused some of the clerics who were killed of recruiting Muslim youth for terrorism activities through their mosques . However ,  despite initiating investigations against them, the government never followed through to prosecute the imams . After public outcry over the killing of Muslim cleric Ibrahim \"Rogo\" Omar, the government set up a task force to investigate his murder . The director of public prosecution promised in 2013 that he will institute an inquest, but has not done so yet . One of the commissions established following the 2007-2008 violence to look at the role of the police, was the Waki Commission . Established to look into the circumstances and facts surrounding the violence and provide recommendations, the Waki Commission found that of the 1,500 deaths, the police was responsible for more than 30 percent of them . As a result several reform measures were proposed including the establishment of a civilian oversight of the police, and many other reforms . However ,  due to lack of political will, the police reforms have stalled . The extrajudicial killings by the police in Kenya are anchored in a systemic lack of accountability and deeply entrenched culture of pervasive impunity . While the police undoubtedly face ever changing security challenges , its involvement in extrajudicial killings make matters worse . Effective security sector reform is the only way forward .",

            "input": "Treating Africans with an untested Ebola drug. It was reported in The Guardian last week that Emergency, an Italian NGO, administered an untested heart drug known as Amiodarone, to patients at an Ebola treatment centre in Lakka, Sierra Leone . The British medics sent to work at the centre raised alarm as early as November about Emergency's approaches to palliative care . Amiodarone, a drug licenced to regulate the heartbeat, has never been tested outside of a lab setting to treat humans or animals infected with Ebola . It was neither approved by the Sierra Leonean health ministry nor listed among the 53 drugs that have an antiviral effect on Ebola . In a report to UK Med, the British healthcare professionals argued that \"the toxic side effects of Amiodarone could in fact be contributing to increased morbidity within the ETC [ebola treatment centre]\" . While the mortality rate at Emergency's centre is disputed - ranging from 58 and 67 percent - the death rate at centres run by Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), for instance, ranges from 50 and 60 percent . Most alarming is the concern that foreign-run Ebola treatment centres could be using unorthodox testing methods with impunity . Emergency's use of Amiodarone without a proper clinical trial or patient consent prompted censure from a senior scientist about the recklessness of this approach and a walk-out over safety fears by the UK health workers sent to work at the treatment centre . Apparently, the NGO stopped using the drug after receiving a request from the Department of International Development (DFID) , which had been alerted by the British medics . When rumours circulated early-on during the Ebola outbreak, that the virus was a form of bio warfare , critics were quick to label these ideas \"conspiracy theories\" . Yet ,  fears about western medicine being used to harm are neither irrational nor far-fetched . As unconscionable as Emergency's practices appear , there is a long history of unethical drug testing on poor and vulnerable communities across the globe . Perhaps one of the most famous cases of unethical experimental treatment was in 1932 when Public Health Service in the United States began the \"Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male\" at a time when there was no known cure for syphilis . The study initially included 600 black men - 399 with and 201 without syphilis  - most of whom were poor and illiterate sharecroppers enticed with incentives such as free medical exams, meals on examination days, and promises that their relatives would receive burial stipends in the event of their deaths . The men were deceived into thinking that they were being treated for \"bad blood\" . They neither received proper treatment nor were they informed of the true nature of the study . Instead of lasting for six months, as originally projected, the study went on for 40 years . When penicillin was developed to treat syphilis in 1947 , treatment was withheld from all 600 subjects . In 1973, a class action suit was filed on behalf of the men in the study and settled out of court for $9 million . Similar experiments were held in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948 , when Public Health Service infected 1,610 total soldiers, female commercial sex workers, prisoners and mental health patients with one of three sexually transmitted diseases - syphilis, gonorrhoea, or chancroid . Like the Tuskegee experiment, none of the human subjects were informed about the nature of the study , nor did they give consent . Unlike the Tuskegee study, however, patients in Guatemala were eventually inoculated with penicillin though it is unclear how many were actually cured . Although vulnerable adult populations have borne the brunt of unethical medical testing , children have not been spared . In the mid-nineties, the world's largest research-based drug company, Pfizer, administered the experimental drug, Trovan, during a meningitis outbreak in Kano in northern Nigeria . The parents of eleven children who died sued Pfizer , alleging that Trovan was used without their informed consent . Pfizer eventually settled out of court in 2009, promising to pay the Kano state government $75 million . For too long, the bodies of poor and vulnerable communities have been exploited to serve the medical fetishes of big pharmaceutical companies, research institutions and Western governments . Yet ,  there is a growing tide against this warped practice . In his 2014 Reith lecture series entitled 'The Future of Medicine', renowned surgeon, writer and public health researcher Dr Atul Gawande argued convincingly that the well- being of a patient is more important than his/her \"health\" . Therefore ,  the goal of medical practice should be \"caring\", and not simply \"curing\" . In the age of Ebola, it appears that the single-minded pursuit to \"cure\" has somehow superseded the Hippocratic Oath to which doctors must adhere to \"do no harm\" . The sudden race to find an antidote for Ebola- a disease that has been around since 1976- must not serve as an excuse to experiment on patients whose internal organs are at risk of shutting down . Unethical drug testing must be matched with harsh punishment, now and after Ebola . We must insist on a probe of the dubious treatment regime adopted by the Italian NGO Emergency, followed by criminal prosecution in the event of malpractice . They must answer to patients at the Lakka treatment centre in Sierra Leone .",

            "input": "TV debates: why broadcasters should give Cameron the empty chair treatment. In a short time, television debates have become a vital part of our democracy . They were watched by tens of millions of people in the 2010 general election campaign , and the Scottish referendum campaign would have been poorer without the two showdowns between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling live across all media platforms . Now is not the time to retreat from the kind of broadcasting that engages so many voters and illuminates the choices they face . Naturally, I hope all the major parties take part in the 2015 election debates . That will rightly remain the aim of the broadcasters . But I believe they should be resolute in the face of a refusal by one party to take part : the empty chair, or the deserted lectern, should be an option . The BBC guidelines do not specifically cover a national leaders' debate , but the principles they set out argue not just that they can wheel out the empty chair but that they should . On general output, BBC published editorial policy is that one reluctant participant cannot stop an item : \"The refusal of an individual or an organisation to make a contribution should not be allowed to act as a veto on the appearance of other contributors.\" That is confirmed in the various election guidelines , where over the years the ability of one awkward candidate to stop a broadcast has been removed . And the BBC and other broadcasters do use the empty chair, albeit on less high-profile occasions : if a news maker is unwilling to face the cameras , best practice is to say so and to cover the topic anyway . As far back as 1987, when I was Today's political producer, we empty-chaired Labour in a campaign debate on defence - to the fury of their leadership . But they had been given every opportunity to take part and had chosen not to , so we went ahead with the other parties and told our listeners what had happened . There is in this current row a legitimate argument about fairness and about who takes part . The arid bureaucratic view would be that this should be based on the results of the 2010 general election and therefore be a three-way debate between David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg . The rise of Ukip and the surge in multi-party politics have muddied the waters , and the broadcasters are having to be more flexible , and I think the Greens should be somewhere in the mix . However ,  I believe we can trust the BBC, ITV and Sky to come up with the right format and a proposal that offers the appropriate levels of exposure to all the parties in the UK across the whole campaign . It is for them, with the appropriate regulators, to make that judgment and not for individual politicians to seek to exclude or include their opponents . It is, in any case, inevitable that some debates of some kind will happen . The Farage v Clegg encounter just ahead of the European election campaign was an example of the asymmetry that may now happen : it was not part of a formal coverage plan , but it was compelling viewing for anyone interested in politics and millions of people tuned in . The digital debate proposed by the Guardian, Telegraph and Google is one viable alternative ; and there is nothing to stop anyone hiring a hall in Manchester and getting Miliband and Clegg to debate there . I guarantee the broadcasters would turn up , and it is significant that the opposition parties are willing to take part in debates even without the prime minister . The broadcasters may, possibly, face a legal challenge about the allocation of national airtime , but in the court of public opinion it would be a brave act to try to close down a debate in which you have been invited to take part but have chosen not to . I'm pleased to say that I don't sense the broadcasters are wavering , and they are prepared to be tough . They are right - now is the time to hold firm . At a time of lack of faith in politicians, it would be the worst option to allow game-playing to block a format that the public find valuable . Electors have a right to see their potential prime ministers live and unfiltered and at length . Those who are willing to put themselves on the line should be allowed to do so . Those who don't can watch at home and see what an empty chair looks like over 90 minutes of primetime television .",

            "input": "Chances of a TV election debate? Choose between zilch and nada. At the time of the last election, David Cameron pronounced that TV debates were \"here to stay\" . It was his confident declaration that:\"We will have them in every election in the future and that is a really good thing for democracy.\" Many others thought so too . More than 20 million people watched some or all of them . They engaged voters in ways that we hadn't seen before in Britain . To many, it was unthinkable that they wouldn't become a permanent feature of the fabric of our elections . It gives me no pleasure to say that I have always had great doubts that this was really the case . For it to be true, you had to trust the Tory leader not to change his mind . TV debates happened in 2010 only because of an unusual set of circumstances . Mr Cameron had demanded them because that is what opposition leaders nearly always do . Nick Clegg wanted to gain exposure that no previous third party leader had enjoyed . In the wake of the expenses scandal, all the parties were anxious to be seen trying to connect with alienated voters . The key was Gordon Brown . Unusually for a prime minister, he agreed to debates . His people thought he had little to lose and, in a typically Gordon Brownish way, he reckoned he would come over as the man of substance while his Tory and Lib Dem rivals would be exposed as lightweights . It didn't work out as Mr Brown expected . But what is most relevant to what is happening now is that it didn't work out as Mr Cameron anticipated either . The Lib Dem leader, an unknown to many voters before the debates, shone in the first one , presenting himself as the true candidate of change to the disadvantage of David Cameron and unleashing the \"Cleggmania\" that now seems so long ago . On election night, I was aboard the boat in the Thames hired by the BBC . Among those also present to comment on the results was Michael Ashcroft, the Tory donor and pollster . As it became clear that his party had failed to secure a majority , he placed the blame on the TV debates . That view has since become orthodoxy in the Conservative party . Whether it is entirely true or not, it has been engraved into the Tory soul . Two people were very badly burnt: Mr Cameron himself and George Osborne , who ran the last Tory election campaign and was widely castigated by his colleagues for agreeing to the debates . The chancellor long ago told friends that he is not going to make the same mistake twice . Lynton Crosby, the prime minister's Australian strategist, is also dead-set against TV debates . Craig Oliver, the Number 10 communications chief who has been leading the Tory side in the debate negotiations, is another key figure who believes it is all downside for them . The first reason that David Cameron and his advisers are against debates is the traditional one . He doesn't want to concede equality of status to his opponents . The experience of the Clegg-Farage debates during the Euro elections hardened the belief in Number 10 that debates are bad for incumbents and a gift to challengers . The view around Mr Cameron is expressed by one close ally:\"If you are the incumbent, debates are heavily weighted in favour of the insurgents. It is a rigged game.\" It is not, as is often assumed, fear of Nigel Farage coming at him from the right that most worries the prime minister . His biggest concern is giving a boost to Ed Miliband . TV debates are the Labour leader's best remaining opportunity to secure mass exposure to voters sceptical that he is up to being prime minister and get them to reconsider their view . So poor are his personal ratings, Mr Miliband might only have to turn up and string together a few half-decent sentences and more people would think better of him . The hope that their man could benefit by exceeding low expectations is why Labour is desperate for debates to happen . Which makes the Tories equally desperate for them not to happen . The Conservatives, as we saw last week with their \"dodgy dossier\" about Labour's spending plans, want to revert to an old-fashioned model of election in which the campaign is dominated by staged leaders' tours in which the prime minister wafts around the country looking presidential and morning news conferences designed, with a bit of help from their friends in the press, to shape the campaign to a Tory agenda . So, from the off, the Conservatives have done everything in their power to prevent TV debates from happening at this election . The broadcasters and the other parties wanted to begin negotiations about the format last spring . The Tories stalled , saying they wouldn't start talking until October . When the negotiations finally got under way, I am told, and by a variety of different sources, that the Conservatives were determined to block any progress toward agreement . \"At every stage, they sought to put obstacles in the way,\" says one source . Another confirms:\"The Tories kept throwing spanners in the works.\" According to a third:\"All the parties, including Ukip, took part in good faith except the Conservatives.\" Last time around, \"a heads of agreement\" about the debates had been written by December . This time around, we have got to mid-January and aren't even close to that . The last meeting was just before Christmas . \"We didn't get anywhere because of the Tories,\" says one source, an account that is again corroborated by others . I have learned that a meeting between the parties and the broadcasters was scheduled for the Thursday just gone . It was cancelled at the last minute by the Conservatives . No new date has been set . The prime minister's latest excuse for nobbling debates is that he won't do it unless the Greens are included . I happen to agree that the Greens ought to be represented in one debate . There is not much logic to Ofcom's recent preliminary recommendation that Ukip and the Lib Dems should be treated as \"major\" parties for the purposes of allocating airtime during the campaign, but not the Greens . They have been nip and tuck with the Lib Dems in the opinion polls and quite often done better . They have had representation in the House of Commons for longer than Ukip . So I agree that it would be fair to include the Greens - and hoot with laughter to hear that argument coming out of the mouth of David Cameron . When did he become obsessed with championing the rights of minority parties? Who knew he had such a passion to debate with Natalie Bennett? In the history of political excuses, this must go down as one of the most terrible . By running away from debates, the Tories are taking some risk with their leader's reputation and sense of himself . Says one senior government figure:\"Cameron doesn't like being called chicken.\" If the Cameron brand is supposed to be the strong and confident leader , why is he frit of debating Ed Miliband, a man the Tories keep telling us is hopelessly weak? Won't it simply look bad to deny TV debates to the voters? Yes, it will , but the Tories are calculating that any fuss will be short- lived, soon forgotten and, in the end, not that many voters will punish them for it, especially if their spinners can successfully sow confusion about who is responsible . The Tories also bargain that the press won't make that big a deal of it . About that, they may be right . There was resentment among newspapers during the last campaign that their capacity to shape the agenda was reduced by the TV debates . There are journalists and editors who will be secretly happy if they don't happen again . As things stand , I think the chances of TV election debates happening are somewhere between zilch and nada . Could anything change that? Some suggest that the broadcasters should call David Cameron's bluff and threaten to stage debates without him - \"empty chair\" him in the jargon . Labour and the Lib Dems hope this will happen . Number 10 is assuming that the BBC wouldn't have the nerve , the other broadcasters will follow its lead , and holding a debate without Mr Cameron might anyway be a breach of the laws about election coverage . A debate between everyone but the prime minister could even suit the Tories when they want to project him as the statesman floating above the fray . A more realistic way to flush him out would be to strip him of the Green figleaf he is using as his pretext for not debating . The broadcasters could redraft their proposal to include Natalie Bennett in one of the debates . Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip could say that they'd be content for her to participate . I think they would . Labour and the Lib Dems aren't keen on including the Greens , who have been taking votes off both of them , but when it comes to the crunch, they'd rather have a debate with the Greens than no debates at all . Even then, the Tories are so determined to avoid TV debates that they'd most likely concoct another pretext for sabotaging them . But at least everyone would then be crystal clear who is to blame .",

            "input": "Why Washington should fear the silence of the anti-war movement. On this 73rd anniversary of the last declaration of war by the United States, as the Pentagon escalates its military actions in Iraq and Syria , the silence of the US peace movement carries an ominous warning for Washington, DC . The streets of major US cities are not filled with anti-war demonstrations , yet the apparent quiet does not signify consent . A look at history shows why . The US has been attacked on domestic territory twice in the past century . On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan bombed Pearl Harbour , killing 2,403 Americans and wounding 1,178 others . The next day, US Congress voted to declare war on Japan , thus committing to active hostilities in World War II . That declaration of war has since proved to be the last in the history of the US . The next and last mass scale violent attack by an outside aggressor on the domestic territory of the US occurred 13 years ago, on September 11, 2001, with the immediate death toll approaching 3,000 . Three days later, Congress adopted an Authorisation for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against those held responsible for the September 11 attacks . In so doing, Congress delegated war-making powers to President George W Bush under the terms of the War Powers Act of 1973 . December 7 and September 11 are notable in part because in both cases horrendous violence against the people of the US was responded to with an act of Congress . Oppose or support US entry into either of those wars, question or affirm that those wars were lawful, there was no question in either case that Congress had signed off on them . Congressional approval . It mattered that Congress approve , because Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution accords primary war powers, including the power to commence and end war, to Congress alone . For a president of the US to make war without congressional approval was an unthinkable act that would have threatened the legitimacy of the federal government . With his war on the so-called Islamic State, US President Barack Obama has committed that unthinkable act , and Congress has let him . And yet ,  by all appearances, no one outside of a handful of members of Congress, legal scholars, and peace activists has spoken out in protest . Contrast this moment with that of the weeks and months following September 11 . On September 29, 2001, upwards of 25,000 people marched through Washington, DC, against the impending invasion of Afghanistan ; tens of thousands demonstrated elsewhere throughout the US . By April 20, 2002, the anti-war protest in Washington drew over 150,000 . By February 15, national protest turnout hit 2 million . Given this history, one cannot conclude that the size and volume of anti-war protests directly resulted from the relative popularity of a particular war . After all ,  the 2001-2003 protests erupted and swelled over a period in which polls showed continued strong support among the US public for Washington's war operations . And in fact, as in 2003-2008 public opinion turned against the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the size and volume of anti-war movement went down . The simple and correct explanation for this history is that anti-war organisers made decisions in 2001, 2002, and 2003, to focus their energies on mobilising street protests , and that in the years 2004-2008, as anti-war sentiment was taken up by a majority of the American people, many anti-war organisers shifted much of their focus to electing anti-war candidates to office . What has changed since Obama assumed the presidency? In Washington, in terms of war and security, very little . Guantanamo remains in operation . The police state has expanded . Assassination and missile strikes have increased . Border militarisation and deportations have escalated . And US military operations have continued and spread further across the globe . Having lived and struggled through this history, why would anti-war organisers choose to respond to Washington's undeclared, unauthorised war against the so- called Islamic State by mobilising street protests? Why would they mobilise to elect anti-war candidates? The core of the peace movement remains active in many parts of the US . Every day I receive notices about civil disobedience at military bases, hunger strikes, local government resolutions calling for a shift in spending priorities away from the military, and much more . For this reason, the relative silence of anti-war organisers in the face of the war against the so-called Islamic State stands out as a warning to the Washington establishment; those who oppose their policies question whether Congress and the presidency can provide effective redress for the grievances of the American people . Washington should fear the silence of the US anti-war movement , for it is full of sound and fury and signifies everything .",

            "input": "US economy: Why I'm optimistic about growth in 2015. Could 2015 be the breakout year for the economy? Last week we got very joyful news :. All of this is good news as we ring in the new year . And the best may be yet to come . So why is the economy finally shifting into a higher gear? This isn' t a story of government-directed growth or stimulus spending . It's the opposite : Washington's role in the economy is starting to shrink after years of Obama administration activism . The private sector is starting to take over . The growth was propelled by a big rise in business investment, up nearly 9 percent; personal consumption, up 3.2 percent; and exports, up 4.5 percent . Government spending, which is a negative for the economy, grew by 4.4 percent, thanks to a big rise in military spending , but domestic spending is still restrained . The news was so good that even the threat that the Fed will now have an excuse to raise interest rates hasn't deterred the bulls on Wall Street . Here is the case for optimism going forward . First ,  a huge factor in the economic rebound has been the fall in energy costs . As the price of oil has fallen from $105 a barrel this summer to closer $70 by September,(and at the end of December it was at $53) the cost of oil imports has tumbled . Imports fell by nearly 2 percent , and this alone added almost 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth . Even that greatly understates the economic windfall from cheap energy . Production costs fall when energy costs do , so the supply of American-produced non-oil and gas products, such as manufactured goods, rises when gas is cheap . Gas prices should continue to fall , the good-news story rolls on , and the addition to GDP from energy should be even higher . Thank you, Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota . And thank you, fracking . Second , businesses are clearly feeling less trepidation about investing , and some of the wet blanket of Obama's anti-business, anti-shareholder agenda has dissipated as the Republican Congress repels his worst ideas: cap-and-trade, minimum wage hikes, new taxes on the energy industry and massive new spending initiatives out of Washington . Gridlock now looks to be built into the political system for the next two years, and in many ways that's reassuring . Third ,  government spending has fallen a lot more than people think . Despite the boost in military spending in the last quarter, the biggest story of the U.S  economy over the last three years has been the retrenchment of government spending . Federal spending has fallen from 24.4 percent of GDP in 2009 and 23.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to 21 percent of GDP in 2014 . Even better news is that in the fourth quarter of 2014, federal spending as a share of GDP fell to below 20 percent, according to a new analysis by Dan Clifton of Strategas, an economic policy consulting firm . This is creating an anti-Keynesian boost to growth, because the government is taking fewer private sector resources each month . The 4 percentage points less of GDP that the government is spending means 4 percent more GDP for private businesses and families to spend . That's close to $700 billion a year more for private investment and construction and spending . This, by the way, shows the foolhardiness of the Keynesian notion of a government-spending free lunch . Five years ago the Obama economics team was talking about multiplier effects from higher federal outlays -- the stimulus bill spent $830 billion-- that would juice the economy with even more private spending . It never happened . Even President Obama's own economic analysis found the economy grew more slowly than it would have without the government debt- financed spending . The real effect of government spending is to crowd out private spending . A final reason for optimism is that the incoming class of Republican governors and conservative state legislators across the country should mean more growth policies coming out of state capitals . At least a dozen governors from Massachusetts to Illinois to Tennessee are talking about tax cuts to create jobs . So even if we don't get tax reform at the federal level , states should be providing an additional tax cut stimulus . Skeptics will say that Obama's executive actions on climate change, immigration, energy policy and so on will continue to be a restraint on growth . That's for sure . This recovery from recession is still nearly $2 trillion behind where we should would be if we had a Reagan-paced boom . This is still one of the most anemic recoveries , though it is belatedly picking up steam . It's also true that wages are still flat for most workers , so the big challenge for the economy is raising productivity so Americans get a well- deserved pay raise . As 2014 comes to a close, here's where we are : Interest rates are as low as they've been in 40 years ; inflation is tame, thanks to the surge in oil and gas output ; and corporate profits remain high . The rest of the world economy, from Germany to Japan to Russia, is a debacle . But that's all the more reason to bet on the USA in 2015 . And ,  no, Mr  President, you didn't build that .",

            "input": "'Concerning Violence': Fanon lives on. In one of the more haunting scenes from Swedish documentary director Goran Hugo Olsson's Concerning Violence: Nine Scenes From the Anti-Imperialistic Self-Defense, a young Mozambican woman with a stump of a right arm breastfeeds a baby with a stump of a right leg . Like the rest of the footage in the film, the scene was unearthed from Swedish television archives dating from the era of African anti-colonial struggles . The woman and child were recorded in the immediate aftermath of an aerial bombing raid in 1972, one of Portugal's many responses to the Mozambican desire for liberation . In typical fashion, the Portuguese and their imperial colleagues instead portrayed the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) as violent terrorists, despite the merely reactive nature of anti-colonial violence to centuries of oppression . After all ,  violence is the prerogative of empire . Among Fanon's sober assessments is that colonialism \"is violence in its natural state, and it will only yield when confronted with greater violence\" . Decolonisation, he writes,\"is always a violent phenomenon\" . \"Decolonisation, which sets out to change the order of the world, is, obviously, a programme of complete disorder\" . The film corroborates these assertions with footage from former European colonial possessions in Africa . Scenes variously depict the subjugation and impoverishment of native populations, juxtaposed with Europeans sun-tanning and playing golf in picturesque African settings in between wantonly extracting resources and imprisoning and torturing people . This, in turn, provides the proper context for scenes of militant African resistance . Particularly illustrative of the prevailing\"order of the world\" is an interview with a white settler in then-Rhodesia who addresses his black servant boy as \"you stupid thing, you\" and laments the impending African reclamation of the territory : \"The gooks have got it.\" When asked by the interviewer to clarify his derogatory slang, he elaborates with more slang: \"The terrs... The whole world is supporting the terrorists.\" To be sure , we've superficially done away with the whole colonialism business, it being generally understood that colonies are bad and archaic things . There are, however, notable exceptions to the rule, as in the case of state of Israel , which is granted a de facto exemption from ceasing colonial operations and is furthermore regularly lauded as a beacon of democracy . But the same oppressive structures that underpinned colonialism continue to flourish in the age of neoliberal globalisation , which functions according to the idea that there is a class of human beings- often but not always determined by skin colour - entitled to a level of wealth and comfort that is only attainable by depriving the global masses of a dignified existence . And as always, a violent apparatus is required to secure the arrangement . In recent years, the African continent has witnessed an ever-amplified US military presence . Writing in Jacobin magazine, David Mizner describes the scenario as a \"soft occupation correspond[ing] with a battle between China and the [US] over the spoils of Africa, which has massive natural resources and six of the world's fastest growing economies\" . Poor Africans might be forgiven for failing to detect enormous differences between this and previous intrusions from abroad . In other parts of the world that the US prefers to think of as its own personal military base- such as Central America - the imperial power has backed the security forces of various repressive and illegitimate leaders committed to violently squelching popular protest . Reasons for protest have included government insistence on catering to foreign corporations rather than to indigenous and peasant communities opposed to the usurpation and contamination of their lands by mining operations and the like . But the victims are largely invisible, the dehumanised refuse of empire and the price to be paid for securing corporate profit . In her spoken preface to Concerning Violence, renowned Columbia University professor Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak explains that in \"reading between the lines\" of The Wretched of the Earth, one sees that Fanon does not in fact endorse violence but rather \"insists that the tragedy is that the very poor is reduced to violence, because there is no other response possible to an absolute absence of response and an absolute exercise of legitimised violence from the colonisers\" . Spivak goes on to make a telling comparison regarding the earth's \"wretched\":\"Their lives count as nothing against the death of the colonisers: unacknowledged Hiroshimas against sentimentalised 9/11s.\" For another modern-day example of legitimised violence and self-victimisation by the very purveyors of said violence, it seems appropriate to once again bring up the state of Israel , which shares the ex-Rhodesian resident's knack for hallucinating himself into a position of unparalleled suffering at the hands of \"terrorists\" . Following last month's Jerusalem synagogue attack in which two Palestinians murdered five Israelis, there was a typical upsurge in terror-hysteria from the Israeli establishment and sympathetic governments and media . Studiously ignored were the various Israeli crimes that directly preceded the event, not to mention this summer's slaughter of more than 2,100 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip . Meanwhile, Israel's primary benefactor - the nation described by Fanon as the \"former European colony[that] decided to catch up with Europe\"- should find much to reflect on in Concerning Violence , particularly given Fanon's conclusion regarding the European experiment:\"It succeeded so well that the United States of America became a monster, in which the taints, the sickness, and the inhumanity of Europe have grown to appalling dimensions.\" Contemporary manifestations of the American sickness include the recent decision by a Missouri grand jury not to indict a police officer for killing an unarmed black teenager in the city of Ferguson - far from an isolated instance of fatal bigotry . Drawing on several of Fanon's texts, journalist Roqayah Chamseddine penned an essay on the aftermath of the Ferguson decision for Al-Akhbar English , in which she condemned the liberal American tradition of placing the onus of non- violence on those oppressed by the state rather than the state itself - an entity that engages in \"unfettered police brutality and judicial discrimination\" against black communities . This tradition entails an obsession with containing potentially \"violent\" black reactions to state violence (eg vandalism and looting) , and ultimately prescribes a superior concern for private property and material goods than for black life . Chamseddine writes:\"Today in the United States many will be grieving for buildings burned and windows broken, while the bourgeoisie will cry out'calm!' and hurriedly search for Martin Luther King Jr quotes to guilt black protesters into supporting their deadly liberal pacifism.\" Suffice it to say Concerning Violence should concern us all .",

            "input": "Why Vladimir Putin should be at the Auschwitz memorial ceremony. On 27 January 1945 a reconnaissance patrol from the Soviet 107th Rifle Division emerged from the snow-laden forest 70km west of Krakow . The soldiers were mounted on shaggy ponies, their submachine guns slung across their backs . In front of them stood Auschwitz-Birkenau, the grimmest symbol of modern history . Officers gazed around in disbelief, then called in medical teams to care for the 3,000 sick prisoners left behind . It is a great shame that Vladimir Putin, having not been invited, won't be present at a memorial ceremony next week to mark the 70th anniversary - at the very least, it would have reminded the world that the advance of Stalin's Red Army forced the SS to abandon the extermination camps in the east . And yet the muted row over the Russian president's absence is a reminder that this particular chapter in Russia's second world war history was, and remains, full of contradictions . . The first death camp to be liberated by the Red Army was Majdanek just outside Lublin, in July 1944 . The novelist and war correspondent Vasily Grossman was on the spot with the 8th Guards Army , which had defended Stalingrad , but an order came down that he was not to cover the story . The job was given instead to Konstantin Simonov, a favourite of the regime , who managed to avoid mentioning that any of the victims in Majdanek were Jewish . Grossman, despite warnings from his friend Ilya Ehrenburg, had been slow to believe that antisemitism could exist within the Soviet hierarchy during the death struggle with Nazism . But in 1943 he had noticed that any reference to Jewish suffering was being cut from his articles . He wrote to complain to Aleksandr Shcherbakov, the chief of the Red Army political department . Shcherbakov replied:\"The soldiers want to hear about [Russian military hero of the Napoleonic era] Suvorov, but you quote[German 19th-century poet] Heine\" . Grossman joined Ehrenburg on the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee to chronicle Nazi crimes, unaware of how dangerous this might prove to be . Several of their colleagues were murdered by the secret police . Certain truths about the Shoah could never be published . When Grossman wrote about the extermination camp of Treblinka , he could not reveal that the auxiliary guards were mostly Ukrainian . Collaboration with the enemy was a taboo subject since it undermined the rhetoric of the Great Patriotic War . As the end of the war approached, controls became even stricter . Auschwitz may have been liberated at the end of January 1945 , but no details were released until the final victory in May . The Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee soon found that its work was in direct opposition to the party instruction : \"Do not divide the dead!\" Jews were not to be seen as a special category of suffering . They were to be described only as citizens of the USSR and Poland . Thus in a way Stalin was the first Holocaust denier , even if his antisemitism was not quite the same as that of the Nazis . It was probably based more on a xenophobic suspicion of international connections than on racial hatred . Soviet propaganda, while designating those killed at Auschwitz in collectively anonymous terms as \"victims of fascism\", also portrayed the extermination camp as the ultimate capitalist factory, where the workers were murdered when no longer useful . And there was a further twist away from the truth . The Stalinists emphasised how many Poles had died there to distract attention from their own crimes against the Polish people, both following the Red Army's unprovoked invasion in 1939 under the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and its brutal occupation from 1944 . They portrayed Auschwitz as the place of martyrdom for the Polish nation . By talking only of the Polish Catholics who had died there, they hoped that the Poles might focus any anger at their bitter fate entirely against Germany and not against the Soviet Union . Few Poles were taken in during those postwar years of Soviet oppression . And now Putin's ill-disguised attempts to reassert Russian control over Ukraine have of course reminded the Polish people all too clearly of what Soviet \"liberation\" meant for them in 1945 . It is not therefore surprising that we should be seeing a certain amount of diplomatic shadow-boxing in the background , while both sides insist everything is normal . The Kremlin is pretending not to have been snubbed by the fact that President Putin has not been asked to the commemoration event ; meanwhile, the Polish government insists it was not issuing formal invitations . The Auschwitz international committee, which includes a Russian representative, was simply asking each government who would be representing them . Putin made a speech at Auschwitz 10 years ago on the 60th anniversary , and no doubt he will again proclaim in Moscow on 9 May- Russia's Victory Day - that the Red Army's defeat of \"the fascist beast\" saved Europe from Nazi slavery . But those countries, especially Poland and the Baltic states, that experienced the ensuing 40 years of Communist dictatorship glance nervously east once more . Russia, obsessed for centuries by a fear of encirclement and surprise attack, has always felt justified in dominating its \"near abroad\" . It was Stalin's shock at Hitler's invasion in 1941, and his consequent determination to create a defensive cordon, that led to the cold war . Putin, fortunately, is a very pale imitation of his hero . o Antony Beevor's next book, Ardennes - 1944: Hitler's Last Gamble, is out in May .",

            "input": "When should voluntary euthanasia not be an option? This week a court in Belgium announced that the convicted rapist and murderer Frank Van Den Bleeken would be put to death by a lethal injection, in spite of the fact that the death penalty is banned across Europe . Van Den Bleeken's case was unusual : having previously been declared insane and not criminally responsible, he had himself asked to be euthanised on the grounds that he would rather die than spend the rest of his life in jail . Today the Belgian justice minister announced that Van Den Bleeken would not be euthanised after all, amid reports that the prisoner had changed his mind . Nonetheless ,  the case provides a fascinating twist to the old debate about euthanasia . Should Van Den Bleeken have been allowed to die? The moral defence of voluntary euthanasia is usually applied to people suffering from a terminal illness . But Van Den Bleeken isn't terminally ill and isn't in physical pain . Another traditional requirement is that the wish to die should be voluntary and competent . But how can the choices of someone who has been declared insane be regarded as voluntary and competent? The concern is that granting his request would make it a case of involuntary euthanasia , and that is usually seen as morally unacceptable . If there is an issue about Van Bleeken's sanity that is because of his alleged inability to control his sexual impulses . But it could be argued that this doesn't affect the validity of his request to be euthanised . The implication is that while some of his decisions might be involuntary or incompetent, this doesn't apply to his choice of death over a lifetime behind bars . Even so , should his request have been granted, given that he isn't terminally ill? One argument for allowing voluntary euthanasia where terminal illness isn't an issue turns on the idea of wellbeing : people should be allowed to choose death where they would literally be better off dead or where their life literally isn't worth living . Another argument turns on human autonomy : we should respect a person's free choices as long as they don't harm anyone else . Someone who is not terminally ill could still satisfy these requirements . Had Van Den Bleeken been allowed to die, critics may say it would have risked opening the floodgates for other similar cases . Belgium has seen a dramatic rise in euthanasia since the practice was legalised in 2002 and permitted in cases of pain and psychological distress, as well as terminal illness . Some are opposed to voluntary euthanasia as a matter of principle . The philosopher David Velleman argues that there isn't a fundamental right to choose between life and death, and that a person's rights don't expand when they become terminally ill or psychologically distressed . He is heavily influenced by 18th century philosopher Immanuel Kant . According to Kant, morality requires that we respect the dignity of persons, and the dignity of persons makes them intrinsically valuable . For Kant, a person's dignity can't be traded against their wellbeing or happiness , and the fact that a person believes that their life isn't worth living doesn't make it acceptable for them to be euthanised . The Van Den Bleeken case puts pressure on these standard arguments for and against voluntary euthanasia . Suppose that, contrary to Kant's view, voluntary euthanasia is morally permissible as long as the person asking to be euthanised would be genuinely better off dead . Relatives of Van Den Bleeken's victim may well argue that the fact(if it is a fact) that he would be better off dead is precisely a reason for not allowing him to be put to death . From this perspective, euthanasia looks like a way for him to circumvent his sentence . Van Den Bleeken's victim was Christiane Remacle, a 19-year-old he raped and strangled in 1989 . Her sisters are reported to have said that Van Den Bleeken should be forced to languish in jail , and their reaction brings out an ambivalence in how we think about the death penalty for murder . Relatives of murder victims often demand the death penalty as the ultimate punishment , but the Van Den Bleeken case suggests that, at least from the standpoint of the perpetrator, the ultimate sanction may be life behind bars . But the intrinsic value argument against voluntary euthanasia can also be hard to swallow, in this case . Christiane Remacle's sisters might balk at the idea that a murderer's life is intrinsically valuable . It's hard not to sympathise , and there remain strong reasons for not allowing Van Den Bleeken to be euthanised regardless of whether his life is intrinsically valuable . As long as euthanasia is seen as a way for him to circumvent his sentence, respect for his victim and her family demands that he isn't given the option .",

            "input": "Welcome 2015: It may be two steps forward, one step back, but here's what matters. Today, January 1, 2015 is the very first day of a brand new year . And for many that means renewed efforts at a fresh start . New Year's resolutions, we call them . This is the year . It all starts now . We resolve to turn over a new leaf - and this time we're serious . This time we're really going to try , we're not going to quit . We promise ourselves that we're going to quit bad habits and start good ones . We're going to get in shape, eat better, be more content, more disciplined, more intentional . We're going to be better husbands, wives, fathers, mothers . We're going to work harder, serve more, plan more, give more, read more . We're going to finally be all that we can be . No more messing around . Well ... I say try . Seriously, try . You might make some great strides this year . I'm hoping to . There are a lot of improvements I'm hoping to make over the next 12 months . But don't be surprised a year from now when you realize that you've fallen short... again . For those who try and try, year after year, again and again, to get better and better, only to take three steps forward then two steps back, one step forward then three steps back... I have good news for you : you're in good company! Everybody I have ever talked to sounds just like me over the years . Try and fail . Fail then try . Try and succeed . Succeed then fail . Two steps forward. One step back. One step forward. Three steps back . Every year I get better at some things, worse at others . For example ,  this past year I've become more patient with my children -- more tolerant of their mishaps . Therefore ,  I've been enjoying them more and micromanaging them less (one step forward) . But ,  due to a lack of discipline on my part, I've also allowed myself to be stretched too thin this past year and as a result, those I love most have suffered (one step back) . Furthermore ,  no matter how hard I try--no matter how serious I am about resolving to change-- I still get frustrated by the same things that frustrated me 20 years ago: traffic jams, unexpected interruptions, long lines, feeling misunderstood, and so on and so forth . You get the idea . In some ways we get better . In some ways we get worse . And in other ways we basically stay the same . Whoever told us that the experience of life was one of escalating progress lied to us . Most of the time it feels rather static, doesn't it? New Year's Resolutions are a burdensome attempt to fix ourselves and make ourselves more lovable . But (and here's the good news), God loves us as we are, not as we should be . God's love for me, approval of me, and commitment to me does not ride on my resolve but on God's resolve for me . The good news that gets me through bad times is that God's devotion to me is not dependant on my devotion . Knowing that God always meets my messes with his mercy, my failures with his forgiveness, and my guilt with his grace, helps me survive my daily disappointments with me . The Gospel of Jesus Christ is good news to those who've been crushed by unmet expectations of life -- it announces that because Jesus won for you, you're free to lose ; because Jesus was strong for you, you're free to be weak ; because Jesus was extraordinary, you're free to be ordinary ; because Jesus succeeded for you, you're free to fail . So , as this new year gets under way, I'll still going to try and get better at things , but it's so much more restful to know that I live my life from love rather than for it . Thank God! Happy New Year!",

            "input": "What freedom of speech? The photos of 40 of the world's government leaders marching arm-in-arm along a Paris boulevard on Sunday with the president of the United States not among them was a provocative image that has fomented much debate . The march was, of course, in direct response to the murderous attacks on workers at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo by a pair of brothers named Kouachi, and on shoppers at a Paris kosher supermarket by one of the brothers' comrades . The debate has been about whether President Obama should have been at the march . The march was billed as a defense of freedom of speech in the West ; yet it hardly could have been held in a less free speech-friendly Western environment , and the debate over Obama's absence misses the point . In the post-World War II era, French governments have adopted a policy advanced upon them nearly 100 years ago by Woodrow Wilson . He pioneered the modern idea that countries' constitutions don't limit governments; they unleash them . Thus , even though the French Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, French governments treat speech as a gift from the government, not as a natural right of all persons , as our Constitution does . The French government has prohibited speech it considers to be hateful and even made it criminal . When the predecessor magazine to Charlie Hebdo once mocked the death of Charles de Gaulle, the French government shut it down -- permanently . The theory of anti-hate speech laws is that hate speech often leads to violence, and violence demands police and thus the expenditure of public resources, and so the government can make it illegal to spout hatred in order to conserve its resources . This attitude presumes, as Wilson did when he prosecuted folks for publicly singing German songs during World War I, that the government is the origin of free speech and can lawfully limit the speech it hates and fears . It also presumes that all ideas are equal, and none is worthy of hatred . When the massacres occurred last week in Paris, all three of the murderers knew that the police would be unarmed and so would be their victims . It was as if they were shooting fish in a barrel . Why is that? The answer lies in the same mentality that believes it can eradicate hate by regulating speech . That mentality demands that government have a monopoly on violence, even violence against evil . So, to those who embrace this dreadful theory, the great loss in Paris last week was not human life, which is a gift from God ; it was free speech, which is a gift from the state . Hence the French government, which seems not to care about innocent life, instead of addressing these massacres as crimes against innocent people, proclaimed the massacres crimes against the freedom of speech . Would the French government have reacted similarly if the murderers had killed workers at an ammunition factory, instead of at a satirical magazine? And how hypocritical was it of the French government to claim it defends free speech! In France, you can go to jail if you publicly express hatred for a group whose members may be defined generally by characteristics of birth, such as gender, age, race, place of origin or religion . You can also go to jail for using speech to defy the government . This past weekend, millions of folks in France wore buttons and headbands that proclaimed in French:\"I am Charlie Hebdo.\" Those whose buttons proclaimed\"I am not Charlie Hebdo\" were asked by the police to remove them . Those who wore buttons that proclaimed, either satirically or hatefully,\"I am Kouachi\" were arrested . Arrested for speech at a march in support of free speech? Yes . What's going on here? What's going on in France, and what might be the future in America, is the government defending the speech with which it agrees and punishing the speech with which it disagrees . What's going on is the assault by some in radical Islam not on speech, but on vulnerable innocents in their everyday lives in order to intimidate their governments . What's going on is the deployment of 90,000 French troops to catch and kill three murderers because the government does not trust the local police to use guns to keep the streets safe or private persons to use guns to defend their own lives . Why do some in radical Islam kill innocents in the West in order to affect the policies of Western governments? Might it be because the fruitless Western invasion of Iraq killed 650,000 persons, most of whom were innocent civilians? Might it be because that invasion brought al-Qaida to the region and spawned ISIS? Might it be because Obama has killed more innocent civilians in the Middle East with his drones than were killed by the planes in the U.S  on 9/11? Might it be because our spies are listening to us, rather than to those who pose real dangers? What does all this have to do with freedom of speech? Nothing -- unless you believe the French government .",

            "input": "What is not being reported in Azerbaijan. While global media appears to be focused on debating the limitations on free speech in France following the attack on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo , it is worth remembering that France is not the only country whose media professionals are targeted . For years, journalists in Azerbaijan have suffered harsh penalties for defending their freedom of speech- from prison sentences to interrogation and the confiscation of broadcasting equipment . On December 26, at around 10:30am, a group of police officers and investigators stormed the Baku bureau of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty , ransacking the company's safe, seizing company documents, the official seal and equipment , while keeping the staff hostage in a conference room for over five hours . Once the search was over, the office was sealed shut . The staff was let go only to be forcefully summoned a day later at the heavy crimes unit of the state prosecutor's office for questioning . In just a few days, over 30 former and current staff members of RFE/RL were questioned, including the bureau's cleaner . On December 30, the government accused the radio and its staff of espionage, money laundering and appropriation of funds as part of the ongoing criminal investigation against foreign-funded entities in Azerbaijan . Similar measures were taken against Institute for Reporters' Freedom and Safety (IRFS), the Media Rights Institute, and International Research and Exchanges Board (IREX) . The offices of all three were raided in August and sealed shut with IREX leaving the country shortly after . The director of IRFS, Emin Huseynov, remains in hiding . Consistent targeting . This is not the first time the RFE/RL station, locally called Azadliq Radio (Liberty Radio) is targeted by the authorities . In 2009, its FM broadcast was shut down . BBC radio service and Voice of America followed suit . For years, the police harassed the radio's reporters, often confiscating or breaking their equipment or detaining them for endless hours of interrogation . On December 5, Azadliq Radio investigative journalist and the host of the radio's daily show, Khadija Ismayilova, was arrested and placed in pre-trial detention for two months . Accused of \"incitement to suicide\" or \"an attempt to suicide\" as per Article 125 of the Criminal Code, Ismayilova remains in jail  - even though her accuser, Tural Mustafayev, has withdrawn his complaint . Mustafayev had accused Ismayilova of inciting him to attempt suicide and \"insulting his honour and dignity on social networks and among her friends following the break-up of their relations and his intention to marry another woman\" . On December 30, the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed Ismayilova's appeal for house arrest . Prior to this charge, Ismayilova was already facing an unrelated criminal trial for defamation linked to her posting a document on Facebook revealing the identity of a man who was an informant for Azerbaijan's intelligence services . In October, when travelling for a conference in Prague, Ismayilova was prevented from leaving the country . A little over a week before this trip, Ismayilova was searched and detained for four hours at Baku International Airport . She was returning from Strasbourg where she talked about the deteriorating human rights conditions in Azerbaijan . Her investigative work uncovered many of the hidden and illegal business dealings of the ruling Aliyev family and other government officials for which she is recognised internationally . Ismayilova is the recipient of Global Shining Award, the Gerd Bucerius Free Press of Eastern Europe Award, the Courage of Journalism Award, and named one of the Brave Thinkers of the world by Atlantic magazine . Was it a coincidence that Ismayilova's detention came just a day after the country's chief of staff, Ramiz Mehdiyev, accused Ismayilova of treason and being a foreign spy? Or that the radio station was raided and then closed in another few weeks time? In his 60-page diatribe on \"Western Colonialism\", Mehdiyev wrote:\"Their main concern is lip service to their bosses abroad and keeping good relations with them . The example is Azadliq Radio's journalist Kahdija Ismayilova . Together with her colleague 'friends' she puts on anti-Azerbaijani shows, makes absurd statements, openly demonstrates destructive attitude towards well-known members of the Azerbaijani community, and spreads insulting lies . It is clear this sort of defiance pleases Ms Ismayilova's patrons abroad.\" He concluded:\"Overall there is an understanding within the society that Azadliq Radio and its employees are on a disgusting path . There is no need to prove that provision of false information is the same as working for the foreign secret service . This is treason . This is what journalists and people with a healthy mindset would think . If the symbol of democracy is Khadija Ismayilova , then it is awful to imagine what future awaits the society.\" Siyavush Novruzov, an MP from the ruling party, agrees . In an interview with a local news site, Novruzov said:\"Every place that works for foreign intelligence and the Armenian lobby should be searched.\" The Armenian lobby is just another popular tool used by government circles to punish dissent in Azerbaijan . Despite its support for Track Two diplomacy initiatives, Aliyev's regime was quick to accuse Leyla Yunus and Rauf Mirkadirov of treason and spying for Armenia this year . Both Yunus and Mirkadirov have been engaged in public diplomacy initiatives pressing for reconciliation between Armenia and Azerbaijan for over a decade . The authorities were fully aware of their work for years . And yet ,  in what has been by far the most unprecedented year of crackdowns, Azerbaijan continues to maintain a steady relationship with Europe and the image of a transforming country, young and rich, and eager to spend so long as its critics keep quiet . With many of the country's prominent advocates, lawyers, and journalists in jail; independent media platforms under attack; and only a handful of international non-governmental organisations left in the country, there is little hope for the country's positive transformation anytime soon . So long as President Ilham Aliyev keeps saying there are no political prisoners and no limitations on freedom of speech in Azerbaijan- conjuring the illusion of a democratic country- little is going to change in this country .",

            "input": "Where Afghan law fails women. Afghan women have come a long way since the dark days of the Taliban regime . Yet a key obstacle to this progress continues to be high levels of violence against women . The legal system has failed to protect women adequately when it comes to some of the most common crimes against them; rape, domestic violence, underage and forced marriages . That is why, in 2009, a number of prominent Afghan women's rights activists, members of civil society groups, and some lawmakers came together to draft a bill to better protect women through legal channels and to define crimes of violence against women . The bill, known as The Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) Law, was decreed into law through an Executive Order by the former Afghan President Hamid Karzaion, on July 20, 2009, while parliament was in recess . During such periods, the Afghan Constitution allows the president to issue decrees for emergency purposes , but the Constitution also requires such decrees to be forwarded to parliament for approval . Some women activists nonetheless suggested that it was not necessary to send the EVAW law to parliament . Political climate . Others, including myself, argued that although the Executive Order on EVAW was a significant step in the battle for the elimination of violence against women, the law remained vulnerable to being reversed by a new president . Indeed ,  presidential elections were just around the corner . As the drawdown of the international troops drew nearer, we feared that the political climate would make it increasingly difficult to get the law anchored in parliament . In addition ,  we feared that any peace talks with the Taliban could end up sacrificing EVAW in a bid to appease the militants . Securing parliamentary approval for the law would give us much stronger ammunition in protecting it against extremist attacks . In order to get an agreement on the EVAW law in parliament, we worked tirelessly for months, using three main strategies . Firstly, we started a lobbying campaign with those who opposed the law, mainly conservatives . Secondly, we went to visit them in their houses, explaining the law to them article by article to obtain their signature in support of the law . We also organised exchange visits for conservative MPs to other Muslim countries so they could explore how these countries had been enforcing similar legislation for decades . Finally we worked through the joint committee in parliament for more than two years to develop a consensus on the law and defuse the opposition of conservatives . In late 2009, there were only two issues left where conservative MPs did not agree . These were the law's punishment of relatives for underage marriage and for polygamy under certain conditions as well as the fact that women's rights advocates wanted to include \"honour killings\" as a specific crime in the law . At this point, however, MPs became increasingly preoccupied with the then- upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for Spring 2010 , thus the process lost momentum . Unfortunately, after the 2010 parliamentary elections, we ended up with a more conservative parliament . Contested election results left the new parliament paralysed for almost a year . As a consequence, discussions about the EVAW law only resumed in mid-2011 . At this time the draft was re-sent to the 18 parliamentary commissions . All but one of the commissions agreed with the text of the law or presented constructive suggestions . The final commission, the legislative (Taqnin) committee, headed by the foremost opponent of the EVAW law, submitted 34 pages of suggested amendments . Some of these suggestions were helpful and were duly included, such as a proposal to have specialised prosecution units in all of Afghanistan . As before, we rejected the proposals to leave underage marriage and the contraction of invalid polygamous marriages as non-punishable acts . We similarly rejected a new suggestion which was to close all women's shelters and arrange for the victims of violence to stay with relatives instead . Although the opponents were vocal , they did not outnumber the rest . What was damaging, however, was an unhealthy political rivalry that ensued among mostly female parliamentarians and supporters of EVAW . Some progressive women's rights activists, including some from international organisations, argued that the time was not right to pass the EVAW and that it should be left as a presidential decree . There were good reasons for seeking parliamentary approval . Yet some of my colleagues began accusing me of using the bill to further my own political career and gain support for my assumed ambitions for the 2014 presidential elections . Instead of supporting EVAW, many female MPs stood silent during the parliamentary debates on the bill and some even went as far as to lobby against it . As a result, when the law was presented to the plenary in May 2013, conservative MPs who were opposed to EVAW were further emboldened . The new Speaker of the House did not hold a lot a lot of influence and probably, for that reason, did not back the bill either . With the conservative MPs entrenched in their opposition to EVAW, a weak speaker and a lack of support from my fellow female MPs, the EVAW bill failed to pass . Those of us who saw the passing of EVAW to be beyond politics, and understood its importance for tackling violence against women, were left heartbroken . With the international community now gradually disengaging from Afghanistan, time is running out for Afghan women . We have made important gains since 2001 , but we need the force of the law behind us to sustain our achievements . We need to arm ourselves with solid laws like the EVAW law to fight the violence and other ills of our society which are destroying the souls of our sisters across the country . The fact that the EVAW law has not been approved by the parliament is the reason for its weak implementation rates ; many justice officials are questioning the law's status and therefore do not apply it . One promising thing on the horizon is that we now have a president and chief executive who both understand the multitude of challenges facing women . I would like to take this opportunity and call on President Ashraf Ghani and our Chief Executive Dr Abdullah Abdullah to declare their support for the passage of the EVAW bill . I also call on my female colleagues in parliament and all Afghan women rights activists and our international partners to set aside their differences and join us in support of the ratification of the bill . As the recent parliamentary approval of the BSA shows, when the government and others make something a priority, the conservative MPs can be isolated . Times may be difficult now for Afghanistan , differences may be wide and security challenges are growing , but failure to back the EVAW and allowing it to die will deal a severe blow to Afghan women's rights .",

            "input": "Where does your tax money go? To many people overseas, the United States government is viewed as an aggressive empire of military bases, drones, and special forces that transcend national borders . But to big corporations, the US government is a patsy that gives away trillions of dollars of natural resources, tax revenues and public assets to grasping giant companies and industries . The US has an unsurpassed record of transferring what belongs to all Americans to a few giant business interests . Unlike any other country, the federal government, under the 1872 Mining Act, gives away hard rock minerals (eg gold, silver, platinum, molybdenum) discovered on federal lands that belong to the American people, to the foreign or domestic companies that find these minerals . In 1986, for example, a gold company found over $9bn worth of gold under federal land in Nevada . The company bought rights to that gold for $5 per acre(less than $6,000 total) without having to pay any royalties on the mined gold back to the Department of Interior . For over 100 years, valuable minerals worth hundreds of billions of dollars have been given away to the mining industry for $5 or less per acre . Once these mines are exhausted, the law only requires companies to do little to clean up their toxic waters and waste . As for other natural resources on federal land such as timber, grazing fields, oil, gas and coal, the companies pay very low fees to the government to obtain these valuable natural resources . The public airwaves belong to the people . Yet ,  under a law passed in 1934 by the radio lobby (sustained later by the television industry), the broadcasting stations control their licensed portion of the broadcast spectrum 24/7 for free . As tenants they pay nothing to the Federal Communications Commission , which represents the landlords , who are the people . These free licenses allow radio and television stations to exclusively decide who gets airtime and who does not . Entertainment and advertisements now make up over 90 percent of the broadcasting time of these very profitable commercial stations, using our public airwaves . For many decades, the federal government has used taxpayer-funded research and development as hand-outs for private industries in the US . For instance ,  the research and development of the Pentagon has resulted in technologies that built the aero-space, computer and containerisation industries . It was the Pentagon that funded the basic and applied research that led to the creation of the Internet . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has transferred, for free, many diverse technologies that were developed through taxpayer-funded research and development to the transportation, detection and medical service industries . The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has funded many of the major pharmaceuticals which, under contracts known as CRADA agreements, are given away to large drug companies . The anti-cancer drug, Taxol, was developed with $31m of taxpayer funds by the National Cancer Institute and, after clinical testing, given away to Bristol- Myers-Squibb under a monopoly marketing agreement . The biotechnology industry was formed out of free NIH research programmes . Without a century of freely transferred research and development investments by the US Department of Agriculture, pesticide, herbicide and other chemical industries would not be where they are today . At the state and local level, companies and their consulting firms put the location of new factories, warehouses or large retail stores up for bidding by the states and municipalities . It becomes a race to the bottom by states and municipalities competing against each other to create the most \"business friendly environment\" with incentives like tax breaks, cash donations and other subsidies to convince companies to locate to a community called corporate welfare or crony capitalism . These deals amount to governments paying companies to make money while depleting their public tax base that pays for schools, public works and other public services . Recently, Tesla, the electric car company, put the location of a proposed one billion dollar factory to produce lithium ion batteries up for bid . Texas, California, Arizona, and Nevada offered large giveaways in incentive subsidies . Nevada won, offering a package worth at least $1bn that included tax vacations, cash reimbursements of expenses and even a cash bonus for signing . Similarly ,  professional sports businesses have routinely demanded taxpayer- funded stadiums and ballparks as a condition of either staying in a city or relocating to another . Many billions of dollars have been spent to make these rich football and baseball giants even richer . This is money that could have been spent to create and improve neighbourhood recreational facilities for participatory sports and healthy exercise . Under those corporate subsidies, the taxpayers are paying far too much (sometimes between $100,000 to $200,000 per job) for their governments' race to the bottom during these bidding wars . There are many thousands of similar corporate subsidy programmes , which are not regularly reviewed by the federal government . Instead ,  Congress just lets them continue on indefinitely without regulatory standards, cost-benefit tests or sunset provisions , which is exactly what these corporate lobbyists are paying for with their ample campaign contributions to these indentured legislators . The most profitable companies in the world make demands for such subsidies . Some years ago the former CEO of Intel Corporation, Andy Grove, testified before the Senate urging continuation of the generous tax credits given to computer companies like Cisco, Microsoft, Google, and Apple . These are companies with staggering profit margins, year after year . Grove was candid when he told the Senators that his industry was not very eager to spend money to do basic research . What these companies do, he noted, is apply the research to their products and services . He called on the government to take this responsibility by extending tax credits (big checks) from the Treasury to pay companies to do such basic work . The unfairness of all these giveaways is inducing a Left-Right alliance that opposes such giveaways . The Left calls this corporate welfare , while the Right calls it crony capitalism . Thus far, the politicians from both the Democratic and the Republican parties have not wanted to make these giveaways debatable issues in their electoral campaigns or the subject of thorough congressional or state legislative hearings . The time is coming for a Left-Right public coalition to go operational and exert political demands for reform of this gigantic largesse , while many other necessities of the people are subjected to cruel, austere cutbacks .",

            "input": "Who is a German? A spectre is haunting Germany and Europe and the spectre is called PEGIDA . Until recently only a few people had heard of PEGIDA, acronym for \"Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the Occident.\" It started as a small protest movement in the eastern city of Dresden against the influx of immigrants, foreign workers and asylum seekers and, above all, against the \"Islamisation\" of Germany . Adopting the slogan\"We are the people\" of the weekly anti-communist demonstrations in 1989 which ultimately led to the overthrow of the German Democratic Republic, PEGIDA's appeal seems to have grown week after week . The hundreds of demonstrators of the first few Monday evening \"walks\" in Dresden have swollen to tens of thousands . Besides Dresden, there are now similar weekly rallies in other big German cities . With its history of anti-Semitism and fascism many find it shocking that a considerable number of Germans, particularly in the east of the country, are flocking to a xenophobic, racist and Islamophobic movement . The surge of the anti-Islamisation movement has led to polarisation of the public opinion, many counter demonstrations and a fierce public debate, involving politicians, church leaders and academics . Chancellor Angela Merkel strongly criticised PEGIDA and called on Germans not to attend their rallies . \"Do not follow the people who organise these, for their hearts are cold and often full of prejudice, and even hate,\" Merkel said in her New Year's Eve speech . Marginalised . Not everybody agrees . Development Minister Gerd Muller of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), warned not to exclude PEGIDA sympathisers . \"The overwhelming majority of those demonstrators are not racists at all . Many of them are low income Germans and they feel they are being neglected, while refugees are offered help . The refugees, but also other migrants, are perceived by these people as competitors . In spite of our flourishing economy there are millions of poor families in Germany . The poor feel marginalised and not represented.\" The CSU, Merkel's CDU's sister party and longtime political ally, has been accused of showing a bit too much understanding for PEGIDA . In fact the CSU's positions on immigration, integration and tougher rules for asylum seekers are quite similar to PEGIDA's . It may well be that the CSU is distancing itself from Merkel because it is worried about right-wing competitors like the anti-establishment and eurosceptic AfD, Alternative fur Deutschland (Germany's Alternative) . The AfD may succeed in winning over many of the PEGIDA-sympathisers . AfD-chairman Bernd Lucke has gone out of his way to advocate a dialogue with this \"new civil movement\" and listen carefully to its arguments . At the same time Lucke tried carefully not to alienate the more \"respectable\" right-wing voters and to distance himself from a too xenophobic discourse . Other AfD leaders are less ambiguous and clearly show support of PEGIDA by participating in their marches and inviting PEGIDA organisers to Saxony's regional parliament . Some German observers don't doubt the existence of an alliance between AfD and PEGIDA . Analyst Volker Wagener sees the AfD as the \"parliamentary voice of the street\" . He notes that the AfD manages to score with a xenophobic discourse especially in the east of Germany . If the AfD succeeds in translating PEGIDA's objectives politically and electorally , it may take a role not unsimilar to Marine le Pen's National Front in France and especially Geert Wilders' Freedom Party in the Netherlands . In fact ,  there is a striking similarity between the anti- Islamisation positions of Geert Wilders and PEGIDA . Like Wilders' Freedom Party, PEGIDA does not only condemn jihadists and Islamist terrorists but Islam itself . Refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and the islamic religion are all lumped together in a vague, scary, threatening mix . Both the Freedom Party and PEGIDA claim to defend the \"conservation of the Judeo-Christian heritage\" . Both claim not to be radical , but PEGIDA and Wilders' party do in fact appeal to right wing radicals and extremists . Neo- Nazis and violent\"hooligans against Salafists\" openly support PEGIDA . Both forces represent a significant portion of the population in Germany and the Netherlands . If there would be parliamentary elections in the Netherlands now, Wilders' Freedom Party would be the first or second political force in the country (depending on which poll to believe) . In Germany, around 30 percent of the population thinks PEGIDA's concerns are legitimate . Some German experts say the debate shows the need for a redefinition of\"who is a German\" and recognition of Germany as an immigration country . According to a recent study, most Germans see somebody as \"German\" when he or she speaks German well and has a German passport . Some 38 percent of those polled said that women who wore headscarves could not be German . To define a new concept of \"German-ness\" and promote a welcoming culture of tolerance and openness will not be an easy task, and should probably not be left to the politicians .",

            "input": "Why CIA interrogations report matters: Torture doesn't work and Americans need to know. As a former professional interviewer with the FBI, I know what works and doesn't . Torture is not an effective way to get information , and the American people need to know that . That's why the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA interrogation and detention after 9/11 is important . The executive summary of the report, written after reviewing hundreds of thousands of the CIA's internal documents, shows that torture was more brutal and much less fruitful than the CIA claimed . In fact ,  the committee concluded that all the claims about the value of intelligence gained from \"enhanced\" interrogation--including the claim that it helped the U.S  find Usama bin Laden-- are overstated or just plain false . Proponents of torture are contesting these well-documented findings . So let's look at the facts . On 9/11, the CIA had few, if any, experienced counterterrorism interrogators . Their traditional purview had been intelligence collection during the Cold War . Inexperienced in this area and overwhelmed they resorted to techniques that merely sounded good but in fact worked against them . When concocting the legal opinions to authorize torture, the lawyers inside our government didn't consult trained interviewers or interrogation experts--the people who actually knew how to get information . They consulted psychologists who helped train U.S  military pilots to resist torture methods should they be captured (torture methods, it should be noted, designed to elicit false confessions) . If they had consulted trained interviewers , they would have found out what I and my colleagues had known for decades: Torture isn't just unnecessary; it's an unreliable way to get information . Instead , as the Senate report shows, the CIA brought in untrained interrogators and contractors and asked them to get answers out of Al Qaeda detainees using methods designed to inflict pain, both physical and mental, and even simulate death . The CIA also employed horrific methods, like forced rectal feedings, that were never approved . I recall when I learned that cruel techniques were being used . I spoke with several long-term CIA officers and CIA polygraph experts with whom I had worked over many years , and we were all appalled , not just by its immorality , but because we knew it would be counterproductive . Apologists say that these methods were used to put the detainees into a state of \"learned helplessness,\" in which the detainee would depend totally on his captor and give up all information . Those of us who have actually conducted interviews know that this isn't the way things work . To get good, accurate information, you want the subject to be as cognizant as possible . You want him to be able to remember all the details and to be able to tell you them . A person will say anything to try to stop the pain , and torture impairs the suspect's ability to remember the details that may be essential to your investigation . Professionals don't need to use torture and never have . On top of that, torture is illegal, both here in the U.S  and internationally . The United States has even prosecuted people for the methods that the CIA used after 9/11 . We are a nation of laws , and the conduct detailed in the Senate report is against the law . For these reasons, in October, I joined 22 other security, interrogation and interviewing experts to issue a statement of principles in opposition to using torture . Not only is torture less reliable, illegal and immoral, we write , but it also makes our nation less safe . When we are not using effective and legal interviewing tactics, we miss information that may be vital to our nation's safety . In using torture, we also encourage other nations and actors (including terrorist groups) to emulate our illegal actions, effectively lowering the bar for the rest of the world, and allow them to use U.S  torture as a recruiting tool . President Obama, on his second day in office, signed an executive order banning the CIA torture methods the Senate report describes . But this executive order could be overturned by a future president . Now that the Senate report's executive summary has been released and the public knows the just how ineffective and brutal U.S  torture was, we need to make sure that this prohibition is permanent . Working with Congress to pass legislation that makes sure a ban on torture extends to the CIA is one way that President Obama can make sure that the United States never again embraces the misguided, ineffective, and dangerous tactics of torture .",

            "input": "Why #illridewithyou is an ill ride. The Sydney siege saw a slew of Muslim organisations issue statements condemning Islamic extremism . Such chastisement had meant something in the wake of 9/11 and the Bali bombings . Today, this has degraded into an automated knee-jerk response . It has been said so many times that its gravitas is greatly diminished . More subtly, this expectation for Muslims to keep speaking out is nothing short of Islamophobic . It assumes that Islam is, at its core, evil . It also upholds the view that Muslims can be essentialised as a monolithic whole . The chastisement thus becomes the yardstick from which the wider world is to differentiate between a good Muslim and a bad Muslim . Surely today, fourteen years after 9/11, we have wisened up to the fact that such atrocious acts are committed out of political, even criminal, intent more than theology . Surely, it is not a stretch to think that no one individual can represent an entire faith community . Surely, it is time, as Max Fisher of Vox argues, to stop asking Muslims to condemn terrorism . In the same manner, this good Muslim, bad Muslim binary undergirds the #illridewithyou campaign . Yes, the hashtag was borne out of goodwill ; an Asian Australian woman started it , as the Twitter universe reacted to the story of a woman pledging to walk in solidarity with another woman who took her hijab off following news of the Sydney siege . We will protect the good Muslims, so gestures the campaign . Unfortunately, it also reproduces an age-old trope that has been highlighted by scholars of postcolonial studies . As western colonisers encounter non-European natives, they began to think of their \"other\" in one of two antithetical ways - either as a barbaric savage or a noble savage . To the colonisers, the hostile savage is inherently dangerous in a sub-human way and always an enemy to the civilised individual . Meanwhile, the noble savage is romanticised as innately benign . Untouched by modernisation, the noble savage should be admired and protected . Transposed to modern times, the hostile savage translates as the bad Muslim and the noble savage - the good Muslim . Yet ,  barbaric or noble, a savage is still a savage . The hashtag #illridewithyou is just as patronising . Another factor that cast doubt to #illridewithyou relates to this question: Was the perpetrator Man Haron Monis the quintessential Islamic extremist? If the slate of profile pieces that are now just flooding our newsfeed can be taken as a gauge , the jury is still out on this . At first glance, one may indeed be tempted to fit him into the mould of what some security experts have called\"bedroom jihadists\", a fashionable term to describe self-radicalised individuals who have been recruited online to plan and execute terror attacks that would advance the cause of clandestine Islamist organisations . Yet Monis was a man of many masks . Closer inspection would reveal that he does not nestle comfortably into this category . His demands may have included an ISIL flag , but he made no strategic overtures that would advance the cause of any oppressed Muslim groups . At this juncture, it is doubtful if he had even made contact with ISIL . Let us also not forget that Monis was not a nobody who was secretly being turned to the ways of ISIL or any other Islamist agenda . In fact ,  he was a well-known criminal . Not only had Monis been charged with being an accessory to the brutal murder of his wife last year, he had also been slapped with 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault . In addition ,  information has surfaced that he had been charged with fraud in Iran , which requested his extradition from Australia some 14 years ago . As a friend rightly pointed out on social media, Monis' criminal records qualify him as a \"sexual predator and misogynist\" . Yet ,  this more dominant aspect of his identity has not stopped the rest of the world from linking the Sydney siege to the threat of Islamic fundamentalism . Yet consider this . During the Sydney siege, a shooting spree incidence unfolded in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania that left 6 dead . International media agencies described the perpetrator, the now-deceased Bradley William Stone, simply as \"a suspect\", \"a gunman on the loose\" and even \"a Montgomery man\" . No hashtag campaign was necessary to assure white people that the rest of the world will ride with them to keep them safe . The same can be observed of the reaction to the mass killings committed by the Norwegian Anders Breivik in 2011 . While Breivik had claimed himself a baptised Christian in his 1,500-page manifesto , the world did not expect Christians to condemn terrorism in the same way Muslims had . This discrepancy is telling of the power imbalance of our contemporary world . To white Australia, #illridewithyou may be its golden moment . To the rest of the coloured world, nothing has changed .",

            "input": "The widening war in the Middle East. It has been a week of air strikes \"whodunnit\" mysteries in the Middle East . Firstly, Al Jazeera broke the news that Iranian F-4 Phantoms were bombing ISIL in Iraq . The Iranians initially denied being in the same airspace bombing the same enemies as the Americans but later came clean about their role to the Guardian . We've also heard rumours of the US A-10 \"tank buster\" arriving to support the US mission in Iraq although, again, nothing has been confirmed at this point . Then ,  on as normal a Sunday as Damascus has experienced in the last few years, the Syrian regime released grainy photographs supposedly showing the trails of Israeli aircraft following a bombing run on targets in the area . Among the rumoured sites that were hit were areas of Damascus International Airport . This caps a busy weekend for Syria's airbases which withstood ISIL attacks in the east of the country on Saturday . While at a tactical level it is impossible to understand what impact the strikes have had , at a political level it works for all sides . The Syrian regime has used its conflict with Israel to justify an internal state of emergency and restrictions to freedoms for decades and can now sell to the war weary public who remain in their controlled areas, the twin threat of ISIL and Israeli \"terrorism\" . For Benjamin Netanyahu, with elections looming, there is no better time for Israel's prime minister to act \"prime ministerial\" and remind voters of his eternal vigilance of the threat coming from Syria . Indeed ,  earlier in the week, Netanyahu said that Israel \"is following the Middle East and what is happening very closely, with wide open eyes and ears- and a lot is happening ... We will continue to keep our fingers on the pulse and we will deal with these threats and these challenges, which never take time off\" . In a letter to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Syria's foreign ministry claimed the bombing happened to distract from the break up of Netanyahu's coalition . Israeli officials meanwhile, would neither confirm nor deny the attacks with an Israeli army spokesman saying he would not comment on the \"foreign reports\" . While Syrian state media should always be read with a healthy pinch of salt , if confirmed , the latest Israeli attack comes in a series that preceded the outbreak of civil war . There is a certain format to this low level state of eternal conflict between the two parties . Israel's September 2007 attack on Syria's al-Kibar facility was again initially unconfirmed but would eventually be told as a strategic masterstroke taking down Syria's nuclear programme at a critical time . Following the attacks, Syria responded with bombastic rhetoric over what it would do in the face of the strikes but nothing ever happened . Since the Syrian uprising and civil war, Israel's primary concern has been with certain types of hi-tech weaponry going to Hezbollah , which was used to explain strikes in January and May of 2013 . A year later and Israel responded to the very physical spillover of the Syrian conflict by launching strikes in June 2014 after shells were fired at their positions on the Golan Heights . Syria responded to the January bombings by warning of a \"surprise\" , but in fact their actual reaction has been predictably mute . The airspace over Syria has never been busier with different nations pursuing different enemies with metrics of success hard to distinguish among the smoke and debris of the destruction . This weekend's attacks, if they are eventually claimed by Israel, would further entrench the growing irrelevance of many of the region's borders as recognised and respected lines . While the focus of global attention has been on ISIL's dismantling of the Iraq-Syria border , the Lebanon-Syria border is also becoming functionally blurred and clearly no longer deters Israel's strategic decision makers . At the most immediate level, the strikes will likely embolden Assad to play a traditional nationalist card to strengthen support among his remaining loyalists . Over in Israel, Netanyahu can appear to be making statesmanlike decisions ahead of a likely bruising election and it cannot be a coincidence that he was in the US when the bombing happened - a nod perhaps to a US green light and the durability of that continued relationship .",

I lived there and helped U.S  companies negotiate trade deals and contracts , but it was not a glamorous job . I spent my last night in China in June 1989 in a baggage X-ray machine at the Beijing Airport as tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square . Only one bus full of Japanese tourists made it to the airport the next morning , and I sneaked out of my hiding place and slipped into their lines ... unnoticed . Not long after that I watched on television as a brave young man tried to block a phalanx of tanks heading into the square . The world learned something very important that day: Get in the way of the Chinese Communist Party and you'll be crushed . The Chinese economy is now estimated by some to be larger than our own . Radio talk show host Mark Levin even predicted on his show that the U.S  would lose its technological advantage to the Chinese within 10 years . How will this happen? Will China send its tanks to New York City and invade the banks, or to Silicon Valley to steal away our intellectual property? No need to ; we're actually handing them our wealth . And ,  oddly enough, many seem pretty content about it . I'm not a protectionist , but I'm no sucker, either . Preserving free markets takes work , but what's strange is that today we're actively distorting markets to the detriment of our domestic industries . History is replete with governments working against Adam Smith's invisible hand, but always with the intention of protecting their own . We're doing the opposite . There has been a debate brewing for decades within conservative circles over whether Congress should give deference to the 10th Amendment and allow States to control their own sales tax systems, or whether they should be prevented from collecting sales taxes on goods sold online under the guise of lower taxes . In my mind there's nothing conservative or free market about protecting businesses from competition . Since online shopping became the rage a decade and a half ago , Americans have enjoyed buying items -- from home necessities to Christmas presents -- without paying sales tax . I made up my mind on this issue in the 1990s after I kept hearing some politicians assert that Internet companies must be nurtured and protected while in their infancy . There' s nothing conservative or free market about protecting businesses from competition . Amazon and eBay look extremely well nurtured after decades of special tax treatment , while mom-and-pop Main Street retailers have been forced to charge sales tax . Well, a game changer named Alibaba, a billion-dollar Chinese e-commerce marketplace that's bigger than Amazon and eBay,combined, is now entering the American market . Fresh off the largest IPO in Wall Street history and flush with cash, within two years Alibaba and its hundreds of thousands of Chinese retailers will be selling the same goods and products to Americans the same way Amazon does . It's bad enough that local stores have had to compete on a tilted playing field against American e-tailers , but extending this uncompetitive advantage to subsidized overseas giants like Alibaba could spell the end for countless American business owners . Congress has the power to change this , and the U.S  Senate has already overwhelmingly voted 69-27 to pass the Marketplace Fairness Act to close the online sales tax loophole . Even Amazon, which fought closing the sales tax loophole for years, now supports the Marketplace Fairness Act . Conservatives in the Senate were divided on this vote , my hope is state legislatures will follow conservative Gov  Scott Walker's lead in Wisconsin and pass laws offsetting any revenue increases with corresponding income tax cuts . Conservatives should be of one mind to keep taxes as low as possible , and we can also work to ensure that markets remain free and competitive . It is now up to the House of Representatives to decide if they're going to stand up for small businesses or cut them off at the knees with a wet kiss for Alibaba . If you're kissing Alibaba , you're essentially in bed with the Chinese government and its Communist Party , which cares even less about the American economy than it cared for the heroic student who stood in front of the tanks in Tiananmen Square . As a recent Wall Street Journal editorial put it :. \"[N]o one in China earns or keeps such wealth or celebrity without support from the Communist Party . ... [Alibaba's Chairman Jack] Ma recently accompanied President Xi Jinping on a state visit to South Korea , and a strong IPO debut could yield billion-dollar payouts for Beijing's sovereign wealth fund and several private investment firms tied to children and grandchildren of Party leaders.\" Why on earth would conservatives and Republicans want to undercut the local small businesses they claim to represent in favor of an online retailing Goliath backed by the Chinese government? This would be the height of lunacy . A standard talking point for GOP leaders, office holders and candidates has been to strongly advocate for small business . If House Republicans don't close this loophole , the damage done to the GOP's relationship with one of its core constituencies could be irreparable . How many GOP incumbents want to see this ad run against them in the next election? It would be both good politics and good policy to close the loophole so everyone - including Alibaba - has to compete by the same rules . That is, after all, what a free market is all about . Dan Schneider is executive director of the American Conservative Union .",

            "input": "Will the awful power of the word 'slut' defeat feminists' efforts to reclaim it? It's been over twenty years since then - Bikini Kill frontwoman and Riot Grrrl icon Kathleen Hanna scrawled the word SLUT across her stomach . In the years since, there's been a book called Slut! , countless feminist debates over the reclamation of the word \"slut\" and, in 2011, thousands of women took to streets across the globe in anti-rape marches called SlutWalks - a reference to how victims of sexual assault are often blamed for the violence done to them . Like \"cunt\" and \"bitch\", many feminists have long tried to wrest away from its original users the power and harm of the word \"slut\" and to give it new meaning . Increasingly, though, it's seeming like we might not succeed any time soon . Take Leora Tanenbaum: in 2000, she wrote Slut!: Growing up Female with a Bad Reputation chronicling girls' and women's experiences with the word . She herself was called a \"slut\" as a high school student in the 1980s - long before the term \"sexual harassment\" was coined - and told me\"I had no vocabulary to understand what happened.\" Now, 15 years later, Tanenbaum is about to publish another book: I Am Not a Slut because, in part, the sheen of reclaiming \"slut\" seems to have worn off over the years . When she spoke to women who called themselves \"sluts\" with a \"positive and defiant\" spirit, all told her the decision had turned against them later- and all regretted it . Tanenbaum told me that, when women are in closed circle or close-knit community - like a protest with like-minded people, or among friends who understand the cheeky appropriation of the word - identifying as a \"slut\" can be empowering . But what inevitably happens, especially in today's digital culture where revenge porn, stolen pictures and cyber harassment is the norm, is that \"it always spills outwards.\" For them it was an amazing feminist experience , but it didn't last . Every single person I spoke to who intentionally embraced a \"slut\" persona ended up being treated terribly by people outside of her circle , because the culture we live in is so dominated by the sexual double standard . But beyond women who tried to reclaim \"slut\" for themselves, other feminists have rightfully asked why we should all try to reclaim a word with so much baggage - especially a word that impacts different women differently, and brings them a lot more pain than righteous justice . SlutWalks, for example, are no longer the cause celebre they once were because some women of color spoke out against the ways in which the protests and the reclamation of \"slut\" focused on the ability of white women to simultaneously embrace the word and reject its meaning . A group of black female academics, activists, and writers wrote an open letter explaining that \"as Black women, we do not have the privilege or the space to call ourselves 'slut' without validating the already historically entrenched ideology and recurring messages about what and who the Black woman is.\" Rutgers professor and writer Brittney Cooper wrote at the time,\"To organize a movement around the reclamation of a term is in and of itself an act of white privilege.\" In response, some SlutWalk organizers changed the name of their protests ; today , while a handful of SlutWalks remain , the excitement over the movement has waned noticeably . But women everywhere are still being actively, physically hurt by the stereotypes that lead people to call them \"sluts\" . Just look to the high profile deaths of young women who were slut-shamed and a mass shooting where the killer said he was targeting \"blonde sluts\" : we're still being targeted because of our identities and sexualities , and it has, perhaps appropriately, put a damper on the once-celebratory reclamation of the word . Maybe that the wounds inflicted by \"slut\"- and the culture that encourages people to define women that way - that we once hoped were superficial are just too raw and too deep . Maybe the speed of the internet is too fast for us to control a word with so much potential to damage . There' s a poster on my living room wall by artist Favianna Rodriguez that reads:\"I'm a Slut. I Vote. So Does Everyone I Sleep With. And You're About to be More Fucked Than I Am.\" For me, it captures the brash, in-your-face spirit that the feminist movement I've loved is known for . But in this time of unprecedented feminist power, the conversation about \"slut\" can be more reflective than fevered . Women who want to call themselves \"sluts\" shouldn't stop, or be made to stop - I love that women can embrace that which is meant to hurt them and find power in it . But I also know that we can still claim our sexuality and agency without using a word meant to denigrate- a word that still hurts so many people . Besides , we don't need \"slut\" to tell us what we already know: women have sex , some people don't like that and we're going to continue to do it anyway .",

As news emerges that the Conservative party chairman, Grant Shapps, has jokingly promised young volunteers that the most active among them might get to go on holiday to Ibiza with Samantha and David Cameron , we imagine what a week on the road with the Road Trip 2015 team might look like . \"What happens on tour stays on tour,\" says one young volunteer, handing out the free, blue-coloured contraceptives as the group pass Milton Keynes , \"but don't let the guys at the back of the coach near these.\" At the back are the socially conservative gang . One has taken his\"It's not Adam & Steve\" commemorative pin badge off and is using it to pierce the condoms . The rest of the coach has just finished playing\"identify the Ayn Rand quote\" , and near the front of the bus the libertarians are swapping pill bottles . \"This is bat country,\" one of them mutters , while another reads a book on the gold standard . After a day's leafleting in North Warwickshire, the team heads to the nearest Holiday Inn where a curry is being prepared . It has taken two days for \"Banter Bus\" to emerge as the name of the team vehicle , edging out Winning Wagon and Chat Coach . \"How to spot a Labour voter\" is the topic of conversation , and it is generally agreed that they are the ones who fly-tip in their own front gardens . Within minutes of the party chairman telling the audience that the most successful campaigners may get to throw shapes with Sam Cam in Ibiza, groups have split off into the corners of the room to form campaign teams . A mixture of Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Taylor Swift is encouraging young attendees to adjust their pocket squares and hit the dance floor . The team encounter a group of Labour supporters who - as Central Office training suggested- broke into tears and fled when shown the standard-issue photograph of Ed Miliband standing in a puddle . Volunteers carry the auto- tuned Nick Clegg apology for similar purposes , but headquarters has yet to devise a Ukip strategy . Later in the afternoon there is a brief tangle with the media as two young men brawl over the correct pronunciation of \"Boadicea\" . Local press are quick to the scene, and get shots of the men before they've been encouraged to remove their rosettes and tie pins . Insiders whisper that it's really an argument about whose dance card was marked last night . \"Oxbridge people get it,\" says one young man as he leans over the table of a group of women enjoying their fourth curry dinner of the trip . This is the first floor restaurant of a Hilton Doubletree, with all the ambience of a young offenders' institution . The women have taken to dining in a protective circle with their handbags on the backs of their chairs, reminiscent of the Roman Legion's \"testudo\" or \"tortoise\" formation . A second man leans in to say,\"Really, most people will agree that it's actually 'Doxbridge'.\" Later that night there are unconfirmed reports that the man who invented the \"Doxbridge\" portmanteau to include his alma mater of Durham has been shivved with a plastic Liam Fox doll and has left the trip . \"We're all in this together,\" one volunteer cheerfully tells the receptionist as the Banter Bus makes an unexpected stop at a sexual health clinic . The volunteers pile off and spend the morning getting tested, only for a red-faced doctor to explain that their symptoms (flatulence, lethargy) are the result of too much curry, and that since only two of them have been sexually active in the past month, this has been a complete waste of NHS time and money . \"We love the NHS,\" a group leader protests , as the others try very hard to look like they're one of the two . For the rest of the day everything is described as \"sound\" , and after six hours of delivering leaflets in the rain, the team opt for KFC and vodka shots . The team are cold . Not only was the heating broken in the village hall they slept in last night, but the windows of the bus have all had to be kept open . The driver has pointed to a European directive safeguarding his working conditions , which has forced the team to crack the sunroof . By lunchtime, the cold and the EU directive has unified two groups who previously had not shared three words with each other , as the socially conservative volunteers and the libertarians demand the coach be stopped outside a Ukip field headquarters for them to defect . As one of the libertarians mutters \"sound\" at the sight of the Ukip flag, a Team 2015 staffer screams,\" You can't say that, that's our word\", and has a cry . In a recount of the votes minus the defectors, the vehicle has reverted to Chat Coach , and the group are arguing whether David Davis or Theresa May would survive longest on a desert island before someone lets slip that they know how to buy Twitter followers . Within a few minutes the group are all upping their social media presence . That evening the Chat Coach stops for the final time , and the revellers enjoy an Ibiza-themed beer and curry night followed by Ibiza-themed laser quest . One volunteer overhears Samantha Cameron's assistant screaming at Shapps over the phone, stating in no uncertain terms that Samantha would rather be trapped in a steam room with the two Eds than go on holiday with Team 2015, and that he could stick his competition . The volunteer tweets excitedly to his 30,000 followers , only to remember that none of them are real . What happens on tour really does stay on tour .",

            "input": "#YouTubeAsksObama: GOP desperately needs a 'Glozell' moment. Republicans who mock President Obama's interviews with the three popular YouTube Internet stars make a serious mistake . While the Obama White House is completely incompetent and weak , they know how to spin everyday Americans . The Washington media crowd, including conservative media, preaches to the choir of news junkies . The idea that you can win a modern presidential election without being modern is what should be mocked . How can it be that some Republicans still don't understand that young people aren't watching\"Meet the Press\" or \"Fox News Sunday\"? In fact ,  news junkies are watching less\"Meet the Press.\" Young people are getting their news from YouTube, Facebook and Ellen . And Team Obama has largely monopolized the playgrounds where Millennials are hanging out . The YouTube interviews inside the White House were an easy home run for the president's communications team . The White House must love the ridiculing they are getting from conservatives, too . The more out of touch Republicans seem, the easier their job to spin young people becomes . The Internet stars who interviewed Obama have a combined reach of thirteen million people - and most of them aren't following politics . They are 'gettable' and Democrats are reaching them . Republicans need to change their elitist attitudes -- and fast . Voters aren't as informed as we want them to be and the Democrats have figured out how to reach them with simple messages . I am not sure how anyone could criticize the president's outreach to thirteen million people . After all ,  one YouTube host informed the president that during the State of the Union address, the most Googled question in America was\"How old is Obama?\" Hank Green, a wildly successful vlogger with his brother, who regularly reaches 2.4 million people through their YouTube videos, started off the round-robin interviews by thanking the president for welcoming him to his house . Obama, showing incredible connectivity with his audience responded with an analogy that every young person understands . \"I'm actually leasing (this house), and my lease runs out in two years. I hope to get my security deposit back,\" said Obama . Green, who was born in 1980, focused his questions on what young, non-news junkies are thinking about their government . Green asked whether something can \"really get done in Washington,\" how drone strikes make sense and whether or not more sanctions can work on a country like North Korea . His questioning was serious . Green also asked one of the smartest questions Obama has had over the last six years . Green told the president,\"I don't smoke pot... I think it's bad for my brain... but I'm for legalization.... how do we move forward out of this legal gray-ness?\" It was a way of forming a question many in the White House press corps have never thought about . Green finished the interview by sharing with Obama a receipt for a prescription drug medication that he said cost $1,100 but because he enrolled in ObamaCare now costs $5 . The moment was a strong message for the millions watching . The president didn't miss the moment either and said of ObamaCare,\"We had some bad hiccups initially... but the website works really well now.\" Glozell Simon, a 52-year-old comedian who goes by the name Glozell Green and reaches 3 million people, was up next . Glozell surprised the Washington crowd by first asking,\"Why didn't the government help Sony feel protected and safe enough to release the film on time?\" She went on to tell the president she cut off the hoodies from her husband's sweatshirts because of her concern for his safety , and then asked a question about Cuba because many of her Cuban friends have concerns over Obama's new friendship with Castro . Glozell, who although is wildly creative and funny, was completely respectful of the situation . She asked about same sex marriage and Obama's legacy and gave her followers a peek at the president answering easy, soft questions . The president looked and sounded relatable . Bethany Mota, a 19-year-old YouTube star who regularly reaches eight million people was the last interviewer . Mota also asked informal but serious questions on education, cyber-bullying, Boko Haram and China . Obama told her,\"your voice is more powerful than the president of the United States.\" And I am sure her young female followers agreed . Mota, too, asked the president a question in a way traditional reporters have failed to ask . \"I was just in China and couldn't access the apps and websites I could back home,\" Mota said . Obama gave her a non-answer that made him look knowledgeable but likeable . She also said,\"I never really followed politics that much... why should the younger generation be interested in politics?\" The president again spun a good tale about the need for young people to get involved so they can go to college . Eight million young women now think Obama wants them to go to college . It was a brilliant move by the president . Obama finished the round of interviews by taking a selfie with the three and adding this eye-opening insight into his reason for going around the White House press corps and sitting down with YouTube stars . Obama told them:\"This is the power of what the Internet is all about... you can create content and there' s not all these barriers to entry... suddenly you get millions of people who are listening to you.\" Republicans are bound to lose the next presidential election again if they can't communicate with new voters . Millions of people walk into the voting booth and vote for someone they like . News junkies and Washington types casually refer to this as\"Who would you want to have a beer with?\" The sentiment is accurate but the analogy should be updated to\"Who do you want to make a YouTube video with?\" I think President Obama is weak, bored with the office, and an incompetent leader . But he sure knows how to go around the White House press corps .",

            "input": "Zero suicides is an admirable aim but it requires all-out change. On Monday, Nick Clegg pledged to sign up the NHS to a national \"zero suicide\" campaign . This comes in a week when I have spent a lot of time talking to the media about depression in an attempt to get people to support Calm and the other charities that are doing incredible work to help people coping with mental illness . I have appeared on national radio, in the press and on television to talk about my story , but the more coverage I get, the more I ask: why me? Let me make this clear . I am not famous , I am not trying to be famous . I am a normal lad who made mistakes, lived a lie, and eventually attempted to take my own life . I am just another statistic . Someone who suffered from an illness that took over my life and made me a person I didn't recognise . There is absolutely nothing special or unique about me . Yet I am getting calls from people asking me to share my story . The fact that I am newsworthy, simply because I have spoken openly about the demons I was facing, makes me think that we are being greatly let down by society . Suicide is the biggest single killer of men aged 20-49 in the UK . It's a statistic that, no matter how many times I say it, continues to shock me to the core . Yet it's something that few people seem to be talking about openly, if at all . I get it, we're British . Sometimes we don't like talking about things that make us uncomfortable . Sometimes we'd rather not ask the question because we can't handle the answer . But that simply cannot continue . It's time that people are made to stand up and face the harsh reality . The fear of being judged is preventing people from talking about their secret turmoil . There is very little being done by the people who have the biggest influence to remove those fears, remove the stigmas, to get people talking about mental health, and make people comfortable with the subject . The media doesn't just have influence, it has a responsibility to help communicate a message and set an agenda . Yes, things are changing , but it can't be right that the furthest we've come is having someone receive live therapy on air with Phillip Schofield or a soap character crashing a minibus . There is too much box-ticking going on . A petition signed, a campaign joined, an empty promise in an election year . All very good but what do they actually do? Do they help save enough lives? The system needs changing from top to bottom . There is no consistency or urgency, despite the high rate of men dying from suicide . What bigger wake-up call do you need? I would ask David Cameron to speak up and tell us what he is going to do . To meet me, to let me introduce him to the small team at Calm, the volunteers, the campaigners, the people on the end of phones with someone's life in their hands . Let me show him people who feel as if they have nowhere to turn . Let me show him the lack of knowledge of some people working in GP surgeries, and the pressure that those who make a positive difference are working under, as rates of mental illness increase continually . Let me show how so little can make such a big difference . If Nick Clegg is serious about mental health then he needs to show it . It's great that he has decided that we need to aim for zero suicides but I wonder, what was the aim before this? Just a few suicides? A hundred? Shouldn't the aim always have been zero? The likes of Calm, Mind, The Samaritans and everyone else, are doing incredible work but it shouldn't be left to them to do it all alone . They can only work with the limited resources they have . They need supporting and backing . We need to put faces and voices to genuine experiences . Speaking out about dealing with depression shouldn't be considered a \"brave\" act ; it shouldn't be an extraordinary or unusual story to read . It should be common . It should be accepted . It should be normal . But while we live in a society that doesn't know how to deal with it, and perhaps does not want to deal with it, we cannot expect people to talk openly about such private matters . Much focus is placed on those who are suffering , and rightly so , but in order to truly help them, we need to make everyone else comfortable and knowledgeable enough to know what to do, how to act, and know how to signpost people to the help that is out there . We need to be talking about mental illness in schools . We need to make in-depth training compulsory in the workplace . We need to be training taxi drivers, bar staff, hairdressers - people who will find out more about a person through a casual conversation than their friends will ever know . We need to normalise talking about the realities of depression, to normalise conversations about the very real prospect of suicide - it is the only way we can move forward together . We need a radical change from top to bottom . Therapy isn't just about lying on a couch while someone writes down your childhood memories . It's about feeling comfortable enough to say you're not OK .",

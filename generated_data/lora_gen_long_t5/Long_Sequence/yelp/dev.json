The salsa verde was good but had very little flavor dueing the meatballs were slightly dry and not all that tasty either; they also had a couple of small pieces of chips inside just fine though there wasn't anything really special about it other than what you get when you order out? That being said, its pretty average place where you will likely run into a few people getting together because most of them would be working more late shift night drinking glasses again soon-but only half are left before dessert.",

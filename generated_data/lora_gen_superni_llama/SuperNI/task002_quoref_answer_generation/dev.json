Given that it is painted almost two millennia after the start of the First World War, as well by its highly publicized exhibitions such worldwide distribution, this was probably inevitable; also its extremely wide range in size combined with very few works to rival it at the time meant that interpretation of these paintings would remain fragmentary. Art historian Albert Boime described it as \"the most important work yet attempted by an artist\". There were many critic excited for Paris in 1889, but the journalist Samuel Langford overstated the critical value of what the painting achieved in his lifetime. This unrealistic view had long since lost all interest when reflecting on how much history it represented and",

Because the window does not allow for full view from all sides, it has been suggested that the artist intended his composition to provide some visual interest to the space. This idea was advanced by Charles Lock Eastlake during idyll sessions and discussions with John Ireland, who had previously discussed incorporating such an approach in future work. Although initially skeptical about the practicality of opening up large areas of the church to a project like this, after considerable deliberation, Eileen Kelly convinced him that by including it in her painting she could make reflected illumination very useful.

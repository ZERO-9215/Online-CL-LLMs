  "Definition": [
    "You are given a question and some answer options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"). You should choose the correct answer based on commonsense knowledge. Avoid answering questions based on associations, the set of answers are chosen deliberately to capture common sense beyond association. Do not generate anything else apart from one of the following characters: 'A', 'B, 'C', 'D', 'E' and only give one answer for each question."

The place was very dark, it seemed as if all the lights from above lit up when they left their table for another waiter. There were 2 separate servers on our table that brought us two different cocktails to start our meal. It was hard to tell how many cocktails each server brought. At first I thought they had way too much alcohol because we didn'T need them, until the next server came along to refill us for free. So for $11 they really weren' let you drink your entire glass(or",

If you're looking for lunch during the week, this is the place! Also the drinks are cheap but tasty. You can get half off everything if there's no wait! Great breakfast spot with great staff!

No big deal, but still annoying. We asked the same thing later and they did not say anything. They just started giving out coupons for different things, which was nice.
